At this point, you have to login as a user of OpenERP France to make a Sales Order coming from a customer 
of this company.

   *Defining a Sales Order*

You should not forget to set the correct parameters in the second tab `Other Information` to select the :guilabel:`Shipping Policy` and :guilabel:'Create Invoice' field.
Here we select the `Deliver all products at once` as ``Shipping Policy`` and `On Delivery Order` as ``Create Invoice``. 

Confirm the Sales Order, then run the `Scheduler` (:menuselection:`Warehouses --> Schedulers --> Run Schedulers`) and run the Procurement from each company (OpenERP France, OpenERP and OpenERP BE).

At this time, a `Purchase Order` and a `Delivery Order` have been generated. The Purchase Order is in the ``Request For 
Quotation`` state and you have to convert it into a Purchase Order to confirm the purchase. The Delivery Order is in ``Waiting Availability`` state because you have to buy the products before delivery.

   *Purchase Order*

Once the purchase order has been confirmed and the reception is completed, we can process the delivery order.

Delivery Order
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Once the delivery order is processed, the products are sent to the customer and we can invoice the order from OpenERP 
France on the delivered quantities.

The delivery order will be processed from OpenERP BE. OpenERP BE is the company that manages the stock of products. 
This company is responsible for the delivery of the products to the final customers. However, the invoicing process will be 
handled by OpenERP France, because it is the company that received the order from the customer.

   *Deliver the Products*
   
From the user of OpenERP France, we can create the invoice for the order (:menuselection:`Sales --> Invoicing --> Order Lines 
to Invoice`), then pass the invoice from the Draft state to the Open state. To finalize the invoicing process, you have to 
go to :menuselection:`Accounting --> Customers --> Customers Invoices` to execute the payment process.

And if you have given above configuration of Sale order, the `Create Invoice` field as `On Delivery Order` , you will find button Create Invoice after Deliver of that Product.
