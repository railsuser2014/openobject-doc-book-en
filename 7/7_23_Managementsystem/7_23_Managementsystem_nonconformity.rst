Prior to create a nonconformity, you need to create the list of origins (how you discovered your nonconformities) and causes (the root causes) of your nonconformities from the menu :menuselection:`Management System --> Configuration --> Nonconformities`.

Then you can create nonconformities directly from the audit or from the menu :menuselection:`Management System --> Management System --> Nonconformities`. You set the partner involved by the nonconformity, an identifier to what it is related to and the employee responsible for the nonconformity, with his manager.

   *Structure of the quality manual*

You then choose the origins of the nonconformity and the procedure involed. In the description, you explain and detail the nonconformity with facts and evidences. 

You choose the cause and then analyze why the nonconformity happened in order to suggest immediate, corrective and preventive actions.

Once all the actions have proven to be completed and efficient, you can close the nonconformity.
