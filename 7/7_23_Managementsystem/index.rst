 *A management system is the framework of processes and procedures used to ensure that an 
  organization can fulfill all tasks required to achieve its objectives.*

The objective of management system is to provide all the required applications to manage your
manuals, procedures, environmental aspects, work instructions, audits, nonconformities, 
improvement opportunities, immediate, corrective and preventive actions.
