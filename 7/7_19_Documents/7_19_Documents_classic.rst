Classic document management solutions
=====================================

Faced with the need to organize documents, companies have looked at a number of document management
solutions that are promoted today, from simple email archiving to complete electronic management
systems dedicated to arbitrary documents.

Unfortunately these solutions have not always been very useful because they are too little integrated
in companies' management systems. Most solutions that we have come across are underused by the
employees – often used by some of them but not by all.

The primary reason for this is that a document management system that is not integrated imposes extra
work on an employee. For example a salesperson should ideally save each customer confirmation in the
document management system. Only that means quite a heavy additional workload just for an order
confirmation:

#. Receive and read the email from the customer,

#. Save the email and its attachments on the desktop,

#. Connect to the ERP and confirm the order,

#. Connect to the document management system,

#. Look for the best place to store the document,

#. Create a directory for the customer and the order if it does not yet exist,

#. Copy the files from the desktop to the right place in the document management system.

This is obviously a lot of operations just to handle a simple order confirmation. You can understand
why many companies hardly use their document management system even if they have gone to the cost and
effort of purchasing and installing one.

.. tip::  Free document management systems

    A number of free document management applications exist. The most well known are:

    * Alfresco: http://www.alfresco.com

    * Quotero: http://www.quotero.com

It is very difficult to keep the information in the company's management system synchronized
with that in the document management system. For example when a customer changes his address, users
will modify the details in the management software but usually not in the document management
system.

Furthermore, since users should create the same storage structure in both systems, you quickly find
after only a few months that the information in the document management system is quite disconnected
from that in the company's management system if the two are separate. For example, how do you know
where to store your least-frequently used documents such as (perhaps) employee car-leasing
documents?

   single: access; user

Also, document management systems are typically very complex because they must manage user access
rights in just the same way as those that are available in the company management system. This means
that you have to enter the same sort of data about access rights twice for the system
administrators.

You will see that the total integration of Open ERP's document management system with the main company
management system, and plugins to Outlook and Thunderbird email clients, offers an elegant solution
that addresses these problems.
