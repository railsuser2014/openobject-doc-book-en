Internal and External Access using FTP
======================================

.. index::
   single: directory
   single: module; document

The first configuration step is to create a directory structure that will be used to classify your
document set. You can use the structure automatically proposed by OpenERP from the menu
:menuselection:`Knowledge --> Configuration --> Document Management --> Directories' Structure`.

In addition to the usual access to documents through OpenERP, you will be able to connect to them
directly through the file system using the FTP protocol. To connect to the FTP server, use the
following address:

========= ==========================================
Parameter Value
========= ==========================================
Server    Your OpenERP server, for example 127.0.0.1
Port      8021
Path      The '/' character, for the root
User      Your user account in OpenERP
Password  Your OpenERP password
========= ==========================================

.. note:: FTP Server

   These comments about an FTP server may appear a bit technical, but
   it is just a general standard for getting hold of files without worrying too much about the platform
   (Windows, Mac, Linux, or other Unix-like system).
   So FTP is just a way of getting access to files without needing to use an OpenERP client.
   There could have been other ways, but FTP proved itself to the developers to be the one that performed best
   at lowest cost.

Once you are connected using FTP, you get to the root of a directory for the document
management system. Once you enter that directory you find a structure that matches the structure
defined in OpenERP.
