Customer and Supplier Relationship Management (CRM)
===================================================

Use the OpenERP CRM application as from the very first business contact - either personal, by email, through your website, ...  OpenERP allows your sales team to concentrate on their deals and manage the full sales flow (lead qualification -> opportunity tracking -> quotation -> sales order) while keeping a global vision of each stage.

Terminology
-----------
Lead 
  A lead represents a prospect (potential customer) or a future sales opportunity. A lead usually is not qualified and not assigned to a 
  sales person for follow-up. Example: a business card, a database of potential customers.
Opportunity
  A sales opportunity represents a potential contract. Each opportunity must be followed up by a salesperson spending time to make a
  quotation or cancel the opportunity.

OpenERP Customer & Supplier Relationship management helps you boost the pre-sales activities of managing leads and opportunities.
Manage complex relationships between partners and contacts, be mobile, and automate your sales flow as much as possible.
We will also develop some business cases to show you an example of how to use OpenERP in your company.
