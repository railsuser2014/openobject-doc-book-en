Communication Tools
*******************

 *OpenERP provides all the information you need to pursue your company's business opportunities
 effectively. But to stay productive with all the information you have to handle it is essential 
 that you can keep using your normal communication tools by interfacing them with OpenERP, 
 and not be limited just to OpenERP's interface.*

OpenERP can do most things you need to pursue your business opportunities. But there
can be quite a bit to learn, which reduces your efficiency while you are learning. And if
that is true for a heavy user of the system, it is double true for an occasional user or someone who
already makes heavy use of standard mail clients and cannot easily change.

So for those who need to continue using their traditional mail clients to maintain their
efficiency, OpenERP can be connected to Outlook and Thunderbird. Your
users can participate in many OpenERP-maintained processes without ever leaving their familiar environment,
and can avoid double data entry yet easily link information to OpenERP's database
automatically.

The two following modules are described:

* Mozilla Thunderbird Interface,

* Microsoft Outlook Interface.

The chapter is a mix of installation and configuration instructions, and basic interaction exercises.

For this chapter you should start with a fresh database that includes demo data,
with :mod:`sale` and :mod:`crm` and their dependencies installed and no particular chart of accounts configured. 

You will also need to have administrator access to your Windows PC to install the Outlook adapter described in the chapter.
