Boost your Sales & Deliver Great Services
#########################################

 The Sales department is the engine of your company.
 Sales success drives staff motivation and boosts your company's dynamics,
 which in turn enables you to keep innovating and lay the foundations for future success.

 The key to continued sales success is effective Customer Relationship Management (most often known
 as CRM).
 OpenERP's CRM features are flexible and highly developed to assist you in managing
 all aspects of partner relationships.
 Analytic tools help you understand your performance drivers, and the automation of data and
 processes drives your company to new levels of efficiency.

 OpenERP can share information through its interfaces to the most common email clients, calendars and mobile phones, minimizing
 disruption to your operations when you first install it.
 Your staff can build on their previous productivity by continuing to use their email and office
 systems, now connected to OpenERP, transferring to the OpenERP interface only if they need to.

This book will help you value your customer and partner relations even more.
