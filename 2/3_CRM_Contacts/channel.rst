OpenERP will help you to manage your Channel Partners. You can geolocalize your opportunities by going to :menuselection:`Administration --> Modules --> Modules` and then typing :mod:`crm_partner_assign` in the ``Name`` field. Check the module and click the button at the end of the line (after the ``State`` field) to plan the module for installation. Notice that the ``State`` will change to 'To be installed'. In the Actions at the right, click `Apply Scheduled Upgrades`. The module will be installed and the menus :menuselection:`Sales --> Configuration --> Leads & Opportunities --> Partner Grade` and :menuselection:`Sales --> Reporting --> Opportunity Assignment Analysis` will be added.

.. note:: CRM Configuration Wizard

        When you click `Apply Scheduled Upgrades`, the Configuration Wizard will be displayed. You can cancel it if you need no other CRM modules to be installed.


Forwarding Opportunities to Channel Partners
--------------------------------------------

You can use geolocalization to assign and forward opportunities to channel partners.

Through :menuselection:`Sales --> Configuration --> Leads & Opportunities --> Partner Grade`, you can create partner grades to classify your partners, such as Gold Partner, Silver Partner, Ready Partner. These grades will be used to determine who gets assigned which kind of opportunities.

Assign the grades to the partners on the `Geo Localization` tab of the Customer form. Also assign a `Weight` to determine the probability of assigning opportunities to a partner. The weight might for instance be the amount that the partner pays for his channel partner contract.

How can you tell OpenERP to geolocalize an opportunity?
 
Either you convert a promising lead to an opportunity, or you go directly to the opportunity you wish to assign to the channel partner.
Go to the `Assignation` tab of the **Opportunities** form, and click the `Geo Assign` button. The location of the partner in the opportunity will be matched with the geolatitude and the weight of the channel partners. The most appropriate channel partner will be assigned.

.. note:: GPS

       You can also use the geolocalization without using the GPS coordinates.

Now you can decide whether this is the correct channel partner for this opportunity. If you feel that another channel partner would be better to follow up this opportunity because he , you can change the assigned channel partner.

To automatically inform the channel partner of the new opportunity, proceed as follows.

Click the ``Forward`` button to automatically send an email to the assigned partner with all the details of the opportunity and the prospect.
When forwarding an opportunity to a partner, you can select which information you want to send: Latest email, Whole Story or Case Information. You can add a cc and add attachments to the mail.
You can decide to send the mail to the partner (any contact person you want), to an OpenERP user or to an email address you specify.

To allow your salespeople to keep a view on forwarded opportunities, the assigned opportunity will be displayed for the selected channel partner on the `Geo Localization` tab of the **Customer** form.

Use the **Opportunity Assignment Analysis** for your reporting.

.. tip:: Google Maps

       Use the geolocalization together with the google_map module. This adds a Map button to your **Partner** form. Click this button to open a browser with the partner's location displayed in Google Maps.

Geolocalization of a Partner
----------------------------

To determine the geographic location of your partners, you do not have to enter the GPS coordinates yourself. OpenERP can do this for you. All you have to do is click the ``Geo Localize`` button in the **Customer** form. The GPS coordinates will now be filled according to the address of the partner.

In the partner form, the `Geo Localization` tab gives you the information you need.
