Information Systems have played an increasingly visible role over the past several years in
improving the competitiveness of business.

all of a company's' daily activities. Integrated management software is today very often a
key source of significant competitive advantage.

Risks and integration costs are important barriers to all the advantages you gain from such systems.
That's why, today, few small- and medium-sized companies use ERP.
In addition, the larger ERP vendors such as SAP, Microsoft and Oracle haven't been able
to reconcile the power and comprehensive cover of an ERP system with the simplicity and flexibility
wanted by the users.
But this is exactly what small and medium enterprises are looking for.
