Introduction
============

We plan to release a series of specific books based on chapters available
on Open ERP.

We will organise these books into the book folder. We use symlinks to point
from the source directory of each book to the right chapter in the main
documentation.

Here are some rules to follow:
* 2 books may overlap, with maximum 1/3 of the chapters,
* Introduction and conclusions must be different on each book,
* When writting new chapters, split different subjects into several smaller
  chapters.
* Translations are managed on the main book, not on specific ones
* As to maintain easy evolution, the same source file must be exactly the
  same from one book to another. But chapters can be differents (addition or
  removal)
* The content of the book as to be clear in the back cover

In order of publication:

1. Logistic, Stock & MRP: 1, 2, 3, 4, 17, 18, 15, 16, 19, 22, 23, C
