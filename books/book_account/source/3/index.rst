Effective Management of Operations
##################################

 Your company is a closely interlinked jumble of people and processes that form the whole system.
 If you want it to be efficient, and to be able manage it effectively, you have to organize it,
 make it systematic, and optimize its major operations. 
 Isolated spots of poor management can disturb the whole added value chain.

 This part presents an approach to greater efficiency, showing concrete solutions by applying
 Open ERP to different problems in a services company.
 For each enterprise function, Open ERP enables you to automate the recurring tasks, systematize
 complex processes, simplify the transmission of information, and control all your operations.
