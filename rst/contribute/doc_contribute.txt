Our Open Source Vision
----------------------

As to build up the best enterprise management software ever developed, we need
a perfect organisation between all Open ERP's actors. So that we can benefit and
leverage the contributions and feedbacks from the community, the market
knowledge and creation from partners and the quality control and vision of an
editor.

We focus on creating a fully Open Source development methodology. This page
summarize the different community efforts on the Open ERP and Open Object
projects. For more information, check "How to contribute".
