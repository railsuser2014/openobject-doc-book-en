   single: OpenERP Online

Nothing is easier for you to discover OpenERP than subscribing to the OpenERP Online offer. You just need a web browser to get started.

The Online service can be particularly useful to small companies, that just want to get going quickly at low cost.
You have immediate access to OpenERP's Integrated Management System built on the type of enterprise architecture used in many organizations.

OpenERP's Online offer includes several services: hosting at high bandwidth, database management, stable security update, backups, maintenance (24/7 server monitoring), bug fixing and migrations.

OpenERP guarantees that the software running on OpenERP Online is exactly the same as the Open Source official
version of OpenERP. Any improvement made on OpenERP will be available online. This allows you to easily switch from the online version to the local version anytime.

So even if the OpenERP Online solution might be the best solution to suit your needs today, you can easily switch to an installation on your own servers according to your company's changing requirements or growth. You are also able to change your service provider
anytime, while continuing to use the exact same system. Hence, you do not depend on your host. In addition, OpenERP works with standard and open formats and programming languages which allow
you to export your data and use them in any other software.

These advantages give you total control over your data, your software, your platform.
