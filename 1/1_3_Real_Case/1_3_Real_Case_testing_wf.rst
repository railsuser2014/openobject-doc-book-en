Driving a Purchase / Sales Flow
===============================

To familiarize yourself with the system workflow you will test a purchase-sale workflow in two phases.

The first consists of product purchase, which requires the following operations:

	#. Place a purchase order with Plumbing Component Suppliers for 10 Titanium Alloy Radiators at a
	   unit price of 56.00.

	#. Receive these products at your Goods In.

	#. Generate a purchase invoice.

	#. Pay your supplier.

Following this, you will sell some of these products, using this sequence:

	#. Receive a sales order for 6 Titanium Alloy Radiators from Smith and Sons, sold at a unit price
	   of 130.00.

	#. Despatch the products.

	#. Invoice the customer.

	#. Receive the payment.

.. _sect-PO:

Purchase Order
--------------

To place a Purchase Order with your supplier, use the menu :menuselection:`Purchases --> Purchase Management -->
Purchase Orders` and click on `New` button.

Complete the following field:

*  :guilabel:`Supplier` : \ ``Plumbing Component Suppliers``\  .

As you complete the :guilabel:`Supplier` field, Open ERP automatically completes the
:guilabel:`Address` field and the :guilabel:`Price List` field from information it takes out of the
Partner record.

Enter the following information

*  :guilabel:`Product` : \ ``Titanium Alloy Radiator``\   - type in part of this name then
   press the tab key to complete it, or click the
   :guilabel:`Search` icon at the end of the line to bring a search box. (if product is previously configured)

When you have selected a product on the product line, Open ERP automatically completes the following
fields from information it finds in the Product record:

* :guilabel:`Product UOM` : the unit of measure for this product,

* :guilabel:`Description` : the detailed description of the product,

* :guilabel:`Scheduled date` : based on the product lead time,

* :guilabel:`Unit price` : the unit price of the product,

* :guilabel:`Analytic account` : if any account is specified then it will appear on the order line (it is not in this example),

* :guilabel:`Taxes` : applicable taxes defined in the partner, if specified, otherwise in the
  product, if specified (there are not any in this example).

You can edit any of these fields to suit the requirements of the purchase order at the time of
entry. Change the:

* :guilabel:`Quantity` : \ ``10``\ ,

* :guilabel:`Unit Price` to \ ``56.00``\ .

Save the order line and close the :guilabel:`Order Line` window by clicking the
:guilabel:`Close` button. You can then confirm the whole one-line order by clicking
:guilabel:`Save`, which makes the form non-editable.

It is now in a state of \ ``Request for
Quotation``\ , so click :guilabel:`Convert to Purchase Order`, which corresponds to an approval from
a manager or from Accounts within your own company and moves the order into \ ``Confirmed``\
state. Finally click :guilabel:`Approved by Supplier` to indicate the supplier's acknowledgment of the
order. The order becomes \ ``Approved``\  .

If you click the :guilabel:`Delivery & Invoices` tab
you will see the delivery :guilabel:`Destination` is your own company's ``Stock`` location and that
the invoice was created from the order.
It is not entirely obvious at this stage, but the invoice is in a draft state so it can be
edited and, crucially, has no accounting impact yet: it is just ready for your accounting
group to activate it.

Receiving Goods
---------------

After confirming the order you would wait for the delivery of the products from your supplier. Typically
this would be somebody in Stores, who would:

	#. Open the menu :menuselection:`Warehouse --> Warehouse Management --> Incoming Shipments` using the expand/collapse icon.

	   .. note:: From the Purchase Order

	      You could have clicked the :guilabel:`Receptions` link to the right of the Purchase Order
	      to reach the same screen, but this would confuse the purchasing role with the
	      stores role. That link is very useful during testing and training, however.

	#. When the :guilabel:`Receptions` window appears, select the name of the entry in the list
	   (\ ``IN/00002``\)   to display the Packing List itself – you would usually do a search for the supplier name
	   or order number in a list that was larger than this – then click :guilabel:`Process` to load the
	   :guilabel:`Process Document` form.

	#. Click :guilabel:`Validate` to indicate that you are receiving the whole quantity of 10 units.

At this point you have accepted 10 units into your company, in a location that you have already seen.

Using the menu :menuselection:`Purchases --> Products --> Products` you can find the product `Titanium Alloy Radiators`
with `Real Stock` and `Virtual Stock` 10. From the product form click on the link at the right most side `Stock by Location`
you can see the `Real Stock` and `Virtual Stock` of this product in various locations. Now click on the `Location Inventory Overview`
Report to see the inventory valuation per location.

   *List of products and their stock levels*

.. tip:: Traceability in double-entry

   Open ERP operates a double-entry stock transfer scheme similar to double-entry accounting.
   Because of this you can carry out various analyses of stock levels in your warehouse,
   along with the corresponding levels in Partner Location at your Supplier.
   The double-entry system, analogous to that of accounting, enables you to keep track
   of stock movements quite easily, and to resolve any errors that occur.

Invoice Control
---------------

When you have received an invoice from your supplier (which would usually be sent to your Accounts department)
go to the menu :menuselection:`Accounting --> Suppliers --> Supplier Invoices`
to open a list of supplier invoices waiting for receipt.
These invoices enable your Accounts Department to match the the price and quantities
ordered against the price and quantities on the supplier's invoice (and since it is not uncommon to receive
an invoice showing details more favourable to the supplier than those agreed at the time of
purchase, this is a useful function).

In this example, you created an invoice automatically when you confirmed the supplier's Purchase
Order. That is because the :guilabel:`Invoicing Control`  field on the order was set to \ ``From
Order``\ (the default option). Other options enable you to create invoices at the time of
receiving goods or manually. The initial state of an invoice is \ ``Draft``\  .

Now click the invoice for your order \ ``PO00001``\  to display its contents. You can compare the
goods that you have recorded there with the invoice received from your supplier. If there is a
difference it is possible to change the order lines to, for example, add a delivery charge. Click
:guilabel:`Validate` to confirm the invoice and put it into the \ ``Open`` \   state.

Accounting entries are generated automatically once the invoice is validated. To see the effects on
your chart of accounts, use the menu :menuselection:`Accounting --> Charts --> Chart of
Accounts` ,then click :guilabel:`Open Charts` at the :guilabel:`Account charts` page to see that you
have a debit of ``560.00`` in the ``Purchases`` account and a credit of ``560.00`` in
the ``Payable`` account.

Paying the supplier
-------------------

Select the menu :menuselection:`Accounting --> Suppliers --> Supplier Invoices` and click on the :guilabel:`Unpaid` button
for a list of supplier invoices that have not yet been paid. Write the
``PO00001`` in  `Source Document` text itself to find the invoice.
In practice you would search for the invoice by order number or,
more generally, for invoices nearing their payment date.

Click on :guilabel:`Pay Invoice` button in the supplier invoice form. It opens the
:guilabel:`Pay invoice` window in new tab with a description of the payment.

``Supplier`` and ``Date`` comes automatically from invoice. You need to just enter the
``Payment Method``.  After that click on :guilabel:`Validate` button to post this entry.

.. index::
   single: module; account

.. note:: Payment of an invoice

	The method described here is for companies that do not use their accounting system to pay bills –
	just to record them.
	If you are using the :mod:`account` module fully other, more efficient, methods let you manage payments,
	such as entering account statements, reconciling paperwork, using tools for preparing payments,
	interfacing with banks.

You can monitor the accounting impact of paying the invoice through the chart of accounts available
from the menu :menuselection:`Accounting --> Charts --> Chart of Accounts`. OpenERP
automatically creates accounting entries from the payment and can reconcile the payment to the
invoice. You now have a new transaction that has debited the ``Payable`` account with ``560.00`` and
credited the ``Cash`` account.

If you look in :menuselection:`Accounting --> Journal Entries --> Journal Entries` you will see both
accounting transactions, one in each of the ``Purchase`` Journal and ``Bank`` Journal in
``Draft`` state.

From Sales Proposal to Sales Order
----------------------------------

In Open ERP, sales proposals and sales orders are managed using documents that are based on the
same common functionality as purchase orders, so you will recognize the following documents in general
but see changes to their detail and to their workflows. To create a new sales proposal, use the
menu :menuselection:`Sales --> Sales --> Sales Orders` and click on `New` button which creates a new order in a state of \
``Quotation``\  , then:

	#. Select the :guilabel:`Customer` \ ``Axelor``\  . This has the effect of automatically
	   completing several other fields: :guilabel:`Ordering Contact`, :guilabel:`Invoice Address`,
	   :guilabel:`Shipping Address`, and the :guilabel:`Pricelist` \ ``Public Pricelist (EUR)``\.  They are
	   all only defaults so these fields can be modified as you need.

	#. Click the :guilabel:`Create new record` icon to open a :guilabel:`Sales Order Lines` window.

	#. Select the product \ ``Titanium Alloy Radiator``\   Although the :guilabel:`Product` field is not
	   itself required, it is used by Open ERP to select the specific product so that several other fields
	   can be automatically completed on the order line of the proposal, such as :guilabel:`Description`,
	   :guilabel:`Product UoM`, :guilabel:`Unit Price`, :guilabel:`Procure Method`,
	   :guilabel:`Delivery Delay`, and :guilabel:`Taxes`.

	#. Change the :guilabel:`Quantity` to \ ``6``\  and the :guilabel:`Unit Price` to \ ``130.00``\
	   Then click :guilabel:`Save` and the line appears on the quotation form.

	#. On the :guilabel:`Other Information` tab of this Sales Order select a
	   :guilabel:`Packing Policy` of ``Complete Delivery`` and
	   :guilabel:`Shipping Policy` of ``Invoice on Order After Delivery``  from their dropdown menu lists.

	#. Return to the first tab :guilabel:`Sale Order` and validate the document by clicking
	   :guilabel:`Confirm Order` which calculates prices and the changes the order's state from \
	   ``Quotation``\  to \ ``In Progress``\ as shown in screenshot :ref:`fig-ch03ord`.
	   If you were in negotiation with the prospective customer
	   you would keep clicking :guilabel:`Compute` and :guilabel:`Save` keeping the document in \
	   ``Quotation``\  state for as long as necessary.

	   .. _fig-ch03ord:

	   .. figure:: images/order.png
	      :scale: 75
	      :align: center

	      *Sales Order Form*

	#. In the last tab of the order, :guilabel:`History` you can see the :guilabel:`Packing List`
	   that is been created and you will be able to see any invoices that relate to this order when they are
	   generated.

From the  :menuselection:`Sales --> Products --> Products` to display a list of
products: just the one, \ ``Titanium Alloy Radiator``\  , currently exists in this example. Its
:guilabel:`Real Stock` still shows \ ``10.00``\   but its :guilabel:`Virtual Stock` now shows \
``4.00``\  to reflect the new future requirement of 6 units for despatch.

Preparing goods for shipping to customers
-----------------------------------------

The stores manager selects the menu :menuselection:`Warehouse --> Warehouse Management -->
Delivery Orders` to get a list of orders to despatch. For this example find the Delivery Order releted
to the sale order which you have created.

.. index::
   single: module; mrp_jit

.. tip::  Running Schedulers

	At the moment your Sales Order is waiting for products to be reserved to fulfil it.
	A stock reservation activity takes place periodically to calculate the needs,
	which also takes customer priorities into account.
	The calculation can be started from the menu
	:menuselection:`Warehouse --> Schedulers --> Compute Schedulers`.
	Running this automatically reserves products.

	If you do not want to have to work out your stock needs but have a lean workflow you can install the
	:mod:`mrp_jit` (Just In Time) module.

Although Open ERP has automatically been made aware that items on this order will need to be
despatched, it has not yet assigned any specific items from any location to fulfil it. It is ready to
move \ ``6.00``\  \ ``Titanium Alloy Radiators``\   from the :guilabel:`Stock` location to the :guilabel:`Customers`
location, so start this process by clicking
:guilabel:`Check Availability`. The :guilabel:`Move` line has now changed from the \ ``Confirmed``\   state to
the \ ``Available``\   state.

Then click the :guilabel:`Process` button to reach the :guilabel:`Process Document` window, where
you click the :guilabel:`Validate` button to transfer the 6 radiators to the customer.

To analyze stock movements that you have made during these operations use
:menuselection:`Warehouse --> Product --> Product` and find this product then click on the action
`Stock by Location` which is at the right most side to see that your stocks have reduced to
4 radiators and the generic ``Customers`` location has a level of 6 radiators.

Invoicing Goods
---------------

Use the menu :menuselection:`Financial Management --> Invoices --> Customer Invoices --> Draft
Customer Invoices` to open a list of Sales invoices generated by Open ERP. These are in the \ ``Draft``\
state, which means that they don't yet have any presence in the accounting system. You'll find a
draft invoice has been created for the order \ ``SO001``\   once you have despatched the goods
because you'd selected \ ``Invoice on Order After Delivery``\  .

Once you confirm an invoice, Open ERP assigns it a unique number, and all of the corresponding
accounting entries are generated. So open the invoice and click :guilabel:`Create` to do that and
move the invoice into an \ ``Open``\   state with a number of ``2009/001``.

You can send your customer the invoice for payment at this stage. Click :guilabel:`Invoices` from
the :guilabel:`Reports` section of the toolbar at the right of the form to get a PDF document that
can be printed or emailed to the customer.

You can also attach the PDF document to the Open ERP invoice record. Save the PDF somewhere
convenient on your PC (such as on your desktop). Then click the :guilabel:`Add an attachment to this
resource` button to the top right of the invoice form (it looks like a clipboard). Browse to the
file you just saved (\ ``record.pdf``\   if you didn't change its name) from the
:guilabel:`Attachments` dialog box that pops up, and :guilabel:`Close` the dialog box. This gives you a
permanent non-editable record of your invoice on the Open ERP system.

Review your chart of accounts to check the impact of these activities on your accounting. You'll see
the new revenue line from the invoice.

Customer Payment
----------------

Registering an invoice payment by a customer is essentially the same as the process of paying a
supplier. From the menu :menuselection:`Financial Management --> Invoices --> Customer Invoices -->
Unpaid Customer Invoices`, click the name of the invoice that you want to mark as paid, or just
check its checkbox in the list:

	#. Use the :guilabel:`Pay Invoice` button in the :guilabel:`Action` section of the toolbar at the
	   right to open a window that enables you to register the payment.

	#. Select the :guilabel:`Entry Name` and type ``Got paid by customer`` and
	   select the :guilabel:`Journal` to be ``Bank Journal`` .

	#. Click :guilabel:`Full Payment`. The
	   invoice is then marked as paid, with its :guilabel:`Paid/Reconciled` box checked
	   as you can see if you select it again :ref:`fig_ch03faminv`.
