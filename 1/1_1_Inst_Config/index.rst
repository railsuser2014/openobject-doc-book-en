******************************
Installation and Initial Setup
******************************

 *Installing OpenERP under Windows or Linux to get familiar with the software should take you only half an
 hour or so and needs only a couple of operations.*
 
 *The first operation is to install the application and database server on a server PC (that is
 a Windows or Linux or Macintosh computer).*

 *You have a choice of approaches for the second operation:
 either install a web server (most probably on the original server PC) to use with standard web
 clients that can be found on anybody's PC, or install application clients on each intended user's PC.*
 
When you first install OpenERP, you will set up a database containing a little functionality and
some demonstration data to test the installation.

   single: Tiny ERP

.. note:: Renaming from Tiny ERP to OpenERP

   Tiny ERP was renamed to OpenERP early in 2008 so somebody who has already used Tiny ERP should be
   equally at home with Open ERP. The two names refer to the same software, so there is no
   functional difference between versions 4.2.X of OpenERP and 4.2.X of Tiny ERP. This book
   applies to versions of OpenERP from 6.0.0 onwards, with references to earlier versions from
   time to time.

   single:SaaS

.. note:: The SaaS, or “on-demand”, offer

   SaaS (Software as a Service) is delivered by a hosting supplier and paid in the form of a monthly
   subscription that
   includes hardware (servers), system maintenance, provision of hosting services, and support.

   You can get a month's free trial on OpenERP's http://www.openerp.com/online, which enables you to get
   started quickly
   without incurring costs for integration or for buying computer systems.
   Many of OpenERP's partner companies will access this, and some may offer their own similar service.

   This service should be particularly useful to small companies that just want to get going quickly
   and at low cost.
   It gives you immediate access to an integrated management system that has been built on the type
   of enterprise architecture
   used in banks and other large organizations.
   OpenERP is that system, and is described in detail throughout this book.

Whether you want to test OpenERP or to put it into full production, you have at least three starting
points:

* no need to install OpenERP, you can test it through http://demo.openerp.com,

* evaluate it on line at http://www.openerp.com and ask OpenERP for a SaaS trial hosted at
  http://ondemand.openerp.com, or the equivalent service at any of OpenERP's partner companies,

* install it on your own computers to test it in your company's system environment.

There are some differences between installing OpenERP on Windows and on Linux systems, but once
installed, both systems offer the same functionality so you will not generally be able to tell which type
of server you are using.

.. note:: Linux, Windows, Mac

   Although this book deals only with installation on Windows and Linux systems, the same versions
   are also available for Macintosh on the official website of OpenERP.

.. note:: Websites for OpenERP

   * Main Site: http://www.openerp.com,

   * SaaS or OpenERP OnLine Site: http://www.openerp.com/online,

   * Documentation Site: http://doc.openerp.com/,

   * Community discussion forum where you can often receive informed assistance:
     http://www.openobject.com/forum.

.. tip:: Current documentation

   The procedure for installing OpenERP and its web server are sure to change and improve with
   each new version, so you should always check each release's documentation – both packaged with
   the release and on the website – for exact installation procedures.

Once you have completed this installation, create and set up a database to confirm that your
OpenERP installation is working. You can follow earlier chapters in this part of the book to achieve this.
