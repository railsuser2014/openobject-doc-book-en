Database Creation
=================

Use the technique outlined in :ref:`ch-inst` to create a new database, \ ``openerp_ch02``\  . This
database will contain the demonstration data provided with OpenERP and a large proportion of the
core OpenERP functionality. You will need to know your super administrator password for this – or
you will have to find somebody who does have it to create this seed database.

Start the database creation process from the :guilabel:`Login` page by clicking
:guilabel:`Databases` and then completing the following fields on the :guilabel:`Create Database` form:

*  :guilabel:`Super admin password` : by default it is \ ``admin``\  , if you or your system
   administrator have not changed it,

*  :guilabel:`New database name` : \ ``openerp_ch02``\  ,

*  :guilabel:`Load Demonstration data` checkbox: \ ``checked``\  ,

*  :guilabel:`Default Language` : \ ``English (US)``\  ,

*  :guilabel:`Administrator password` : \ ``admin``\  (because it is easiest to remember at this stage, but obviously completely insecure),

*  :guilabel:`Confirm password` : \ ``admin``\  .
