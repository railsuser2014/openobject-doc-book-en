First steps with Open ERP
#########################

 Open ERP is an impressive software system, being simple to use and yet providing great benefits
 in helping you manage your company.
 It's easy to install under both Windows and Linux compared with other enterprise-scale systems,
 and offers unmatched functionality.

 The objective of this first part of the book is to help you to start discovering it in practice.

 The first chapter, :ref:`ch-inst`, gives detailed guidance for installing it.
 If you're not a systems administrator, or if you've already installed
 Open ERP, or if you're planning to use an online SaaS provider, then you can skip this chapter and
 move straight to the next chapter, :ref:`ch-guided`. 
 There, you're taken on a step-by-step guided tour using the information 
 in its demonstration database.
 
 If you've already used Open ERP (or Tiny ERP) a bit then you can move
 past that to the third chapter in this part of the book.
 In :ref:`ch-real` you can try out a real case, from scratch in a new database,
 by developing a complete business workflow that runs from purchase to sale of goods.
