The point of sale provides maximum efficiency, with all retail transactions conducted. Since the point-of-sale application is parameter-driven, you determine what, if any, information, you must enter to begin an order. For most businesses with a point-of-sale operation, a cash sale is the most common type of transaction. Depending on the way you set up your parameters, the Cash Sale Customer will be displayed and the paycode will default to cash.

Daily sales of products, picking and delivery of the products and invoicing are the main features that is provided by this module. In and out of the cash is being maintained using Cash Registers. Each cash register is created based on the Cash / Bank Journals so it will make easier to create journal entries and thus we can keep track of all accounting entries in appropriate accounts.
