   single: alerts
   single: module; warning

To manage alerts on products or partners, you can install the :mod:`warning` module. Once that is
installed, you will be able to configure a series of alerts on the partners or products by
setting parameters in the new :guilabel:`Warnings` tab on each of the forms.

You can select any of the following types of warnings and create different warnings for purchase and for sales:

* :guilabel:`No Message`: This option will not display a message.

* :guilabel:`Warning`: This option will show the user the message entered.

* :guilabel:`Blocking Message`: The message displayed will cause an exception and block the workflow.

You can activate alerts for a series of events. For each alert, you should enter a message that will
be displayed when the event concerned is started.

   *Management of alerts on partners*

The available warnings in the partner form are:

* Create a warning for a sales order,

* Create a warning for a purchase order,

* Create a warning for a delivery to a partner (or receiving an item),

* Create a warning when invoicing a partner.

For example, if you enter an alert for the invoicing of a customer, for an accountant entering an
invoice for that customer, the alert message will be attached as shown in the figure :ref:`fig-warnsmp`:
