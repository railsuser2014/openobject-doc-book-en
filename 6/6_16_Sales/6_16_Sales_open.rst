Open Orders
===========

.. index::
   single: module; sale_delivery

In some industries, customers commonly place orders for a certain volume of products and ask for regular
deliveries from an order up to the total amount on it. This principle, called open orders, is managed
by the :mod:`sale_delivery` module in OpenERP.

OpenERP handles open orders easily. An open order is an order for a
certain quantity of products but whose deliveries are planned for various dates over a period of
time.

To do that, you must install the :mod:`sale_delivery` module (in ``extra-addons`` at the time of writing). 
A Sales Order is entered as a normal order
but you also set the total quantity that will be delivered on each order line.

Then you can use the new tab :guilabel:`Deliveries` on the order to plan the quantities sold and enter your
delivery planning there.

   *Managing open orders, planning forecasts*

In the order lines, OpenERP shows you the quantity planned in addition to the quantity sold so you
can verify that the quantities sold equal the quantities to be delivered. When you confirm the
order, OpenERP no longer generates a single delivery order but plans scheduled despatches.

.. tip:: Invoicing Mode

   If you work with Open Orders, you should set :guilabel:`Invoice Control` to the mode ``Shipped Quantities``.
   Then the storesperson will be able to re-plan and change the quantities of the forecast deliveries
   in the system.
