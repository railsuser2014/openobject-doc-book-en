******************
Driving your Sales
******************

  *This chapter describes OpenERP's sales management, following the complete sales order process from
  quotation to customer order, including the management of deliveries and invoicing. 
  It does not look at customer relations and pre-sales, which are handled by the CRM
  (Customer Relationship Management) modules described in an earlier part of the book.*
  
  *It also describes the management of carriers, margin control and reporting,
  price management and the handling of various types of sales discount campaigns.*
  
For this chapter you should start with a fresh database that includes demonstration data,
with :mod:`sale` and its dependencies installed and no particular chart of accounts configured.
