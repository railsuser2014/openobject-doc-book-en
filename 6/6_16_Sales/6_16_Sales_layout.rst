Layout templates
================

.. index::
   single: module; sale_layout

The :mod:`sale_layout` module enables you to have a more elaborate template than the standard order
forms.

For example you could put the following in the order lines:

* a horizontal separator line,

* titles and subtitles,

* subtotals at the end of the section,

* comments,

* a page break.

.. index::
   single: module; account_invoice_layout

This enables you to lay out a more elaborate professional-looking quotation page. There's also the
module :mod:`account_invoice_layout` which gives you the same functionality for invoice templates.

The two figures :ref:`fig-invlayfrm` and :ref:`fig-invlayprin` show an invoice template in Open ERP 
and the resulting printed invoice.

.. _fig-invlayfrm:

.. figure:: images/invoice_layout_form.png
   :scale: 75
   :align: center
