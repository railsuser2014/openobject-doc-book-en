OpenERP enables you to perform analysis of purchases by period (current year, current month,
previous month), by state (quotations, orders), supplier, user, product, category, warehouse
and so on. This is made possible through a search view accessed through the
menu :menuselection:`Purchases --> Reporting --> Purchase Analysis`.

   *Analysis of Purchases over the Month by Product*

This analysis is carried out on supplier orders and not on invoices or the quantities actually
received. To get an analysis by product, use the module :mod:`product_margin`. The function of this
module is described in detail in the chapter :ref:`ch-sales`.

To analyze the received quantities, you can use the statistical reports in Warehouse.
