**********************
Driving your Purchases
**********************

 *In the preceding chapters you saw how to use customer invoices and delivery notes in OpenERP.
 This chapter is about the management of purchases, the process ahead of these two operations.
 You will now see how OpenERP handles and simplifies this and the control of purchases from
 suppliers.*

For this chapter you should start with a fresh database that includes demonstration data,
with :mod:`purchase` and its dependencies installed
and no particular chart of accounts configured.
