Analytic accounts
=================

To manage purchases by project you should use the analytic accounts. 
You can set an analytic account on each line of a supplier order. 
The analytic costs linked to this purchase will be managed
by OpenERP from the goods receipt and confirmation of the supplier invoice.

.. index::
   single: module; hr_timesheet_invoice

The :mod:`hr_timesheet_invoice` module lets you reinvoice the analytic costs automatically using
parameters in the analytic accounts such as sale pricelist, associated partner company, and maximum amount.

So you can put an invoice order with a defined invoice workflow in place based on the analytic accounts. If you're
working ``Make to Order``, the workflow will be:

#. Customer Order,

#. Procurement order on Supplier,

#. Receive invoice and goods from the supplier,

#. Delivery and invoicing to the customer.

When re-invoicing based on costs you'd get the following workflow:

#. Enter the customer contract conditions from the analytic accounts,

#. Purchase raw materials and write the services performed into the timesheets,

#. Receive the supplier invoice and the products,

#. Invoice these costs to the customer.

.. index::
   single: module; purchase_analytic_plans

.. tip:: Analytic multiplans

   If you want several analysis plans you should install the module :mod:`purchase_analytic_plans`.
   These let you split a line on a supplier purchase order into several accounts and analytic
   plans.
   Look back at :ref:`ch-accts` for more information on the use of analytic accounts.
