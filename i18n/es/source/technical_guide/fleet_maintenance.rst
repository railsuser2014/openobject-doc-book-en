  Manage the maintenance contracts of a product fleet (streaming servers originally).
  
  Now partners have fleets and sub-fleets for which they can buy products that can eventually 
  be covered by paid maintenance contracts.
  
  Fleet: a stock.location for which all products have the same maintenance end date anniversary.
  Indeed, it's useful to have several maintenance contracts for a given partner with a single 
  anniversary date for an eventual renewal.
  Meaning that if the customer wants a different end date anniversaries for two mainteance contracts,
  then he should have several Fleets.
  Products don't go in the Fleets actually, they go in their Sub-Fleets instead.
  
  Sub-Fleet: a stock.location child of a Fleet which might contains some purchased products.
  In a sub-fleet, ALL the maintenance contracts of the products have exactly the same start date 
  and end date.
  Meaning that if a customer need several different start date or some years offset for the 
  end date, then he should have several Sub-Fleets.
  
  This module also take care of proposing ideal maintenance dates given a few rules that might
  be changed in your specific case (Ideally they wouldn't be hardcoded or at least have some
  parameters externalized to the database).
  
  Finally, this module also takes care of after sale incidents, extending the native CRM and thus
  preserving all the CRM power.
  Given a product serial number (prodlot), it's able to retrieve the Fleet and Partner and know if a 
  product is still covered by a maintenance contract or not. 
  It also deals with reparation movements in a simple manner, that might later on made compatible with 
  the mrp_repair module which was too complex for our  first use here. 
  
  This module is also fully compliant with the native prodlot tracking of OpenERP to knwo
  where is a serial number, be it a finished product or only a part, and even after a replacement
  if movements are properly entered in the crm incident. For a better tracking experience, it's
