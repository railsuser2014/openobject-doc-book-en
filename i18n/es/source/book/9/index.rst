Open ERP has become established as the main free market-changing alternative for enterprise
management systems
in amongst software from giants such as SAP, Oracle and Microsoft,
and from the small software developers in their own niches.

.. i18n: Until now only two main alternatives existed for systems that manage a company's information:
.. i18n: install a proprietary ERP system, complete but usually overweight, inflexible, and expensive;
.. i18n: or develop a solution internally, adapted to current needs but often expensive to develop, not
.. i18n: integrated, and incomplete.

Until now only two main alternatives existed for systems that manage a company's information:
install a proprietary ERP system, complete but usually overweight, inflexible, and expensive;
or develop a solution internally, adapted to current needs but often expensive to develop, not
integrated, and incomplete.

.. i18n: With its free business model, Open ERP combines the advantages of a complete ERP system with the
.. i18n: flexibility of an in-house solution.
.. i18n: The open source code, the project's general flexibility, and its hundreds of modules
.. i18n: let you construct a solution from a selection of the modules already available and
.. i18n: you can then freely update it as your needs evolve.

The open source code, the project's general flexibility, and its hundreds of modules
let you construct a solution from a selection of the modules already available and
you can then freely update it as your needs evolve.

.. i18n: The results will be at the top end of what you might expect from any ERP system,
.. i18n: let alone an Open Source system.
.. i18n: The considerable gains in productivity, efficiency and visibility become apparent only a few months
.. i18n: after implementation.
.. i18n: And you can gain from increased operational quality even if you reduce your human resourcing
.. i18n: intensity.
.. i18n: Because there are fewer repetitive tasks for your staff to do,
.. i18n: they can concentrate on higher added-value work.
.. i18n: We frequently receive the gratitude of senior management who get better results from their
.. i18n: business because they've adopted Open ERP.

An SaaS package is suited to the needs of small enterprises that don't have very specific needs, and
where the initial cost and the delay of implementation are critical factors.
