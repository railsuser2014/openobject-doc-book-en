Searching for documents
=======================

.. i18n: You've seen several methods of accessing documents quickly:

You've seen several methods of accessing documents quickly:

.. i18n: * From attachments to an Open ERP resource,
.. i18n: 
.. i18n: * Through FTP access to Open ERP,
.. i18n: 
.. i18n: * Using the menu :menuselection:`Document Management --> Structure of Directories`.

* From attachments to an Open ERP resource,

* Through FTP access to Open ERP,

* Using the menu :menuselection:`Document Management --> Structure of Directories`.

.. i18n: But if you don't know where a specific document can be found, Open ERP also has a search tool
.. i18n: integrated into its document management. To search for a file use the menu :menuselection:`Document
.. i18n: Management --> Search for a file`. You get to a document search screen that lets you search amongst
.. i18n: all the attachments and all the documents in the FTP server.

.. i18n: You can search for a file using various different criteria:

You can search for a file using various different criteria:

.. i18n: * The filename,
.. i18n: 
.. i18n: * The owner of a file,
.. i18n: 
.. i18n: * The title of the resource that the file is attached to,
.. i18n: 
.. i18n: * The partner that the document is about,
.. i18n: 
.. i18n: * The directory that it's found in,
.. i18n: 
.. i18n: * Its creation and modification dates.

* The filename,

* The owner of a file,

* The title of the resource that the file is attached to,

* The partner that the document is about,

* The directory that it's found in,

* Its creation and modification dates.

.. i18n: Notice here an important advantage for an integrated document management system. Information such as
.. i18n: which partner is associated with a document is automatically detected by Open ERP when the document
.. i18n: has been stored in a directory. This information is never input by the user – it's detected
.. i18n: automatically using the information about the resource when it's being saved as a file.

.. i18n: Each file is automatically indexed by the system to give you a search engine rather like Google's on
.. i18n: the whole set of company documents.

.. i18n: .. note:: Supported file formats
.. i18n: 
.. i18n:     The Open ERP document management system can index the following file formats:
.. i18n: 
.. i18n:     * **TXT** : text files,
.. i18n: 
.. i18n:     * **PDF** : PDF files,
.. i18n: 
.. i18n:     * **SXW** : Open Office V1 files,
.. i18n: 
.. i18n:     * **ODT** : Open Office V2 files,
.. i18n: 
.. i18n:     * **DOC** : Microsoft Word files.

    is not indexed automatically.

.. i18n: This functionality is very significant. All you need to do is search for a partner name or an order
.. i18n: number to automatically get all the documents that are referenced there. And you can use a fragment
.. i18n: of text to find the document you need from within that subset.

.. i18n: you sent it, even if the company's details have changed in the meantime.
