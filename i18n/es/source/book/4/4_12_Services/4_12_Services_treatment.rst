.. i18n: Expenses generated by employees are grouped into periods of a week or a month. At the end of the

manager. The manager is responsible for approving all the expense requests generated by his team.
The expenses sheet must be signed by the employee, who also attaches her receipts there.

.. i18n: Once the sheet has been approved by the head of department it is sent to accounts, who register the

.. i18n: You often need to invoice expenses to a client, depending on the precise contract that's been

.. i18n: If your systems handle expenses well then you can avoid significant losses by setting your terms of

.. i18n: to the maximum, to recharge as much as you are contractually able.
