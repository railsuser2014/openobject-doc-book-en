There are two major approaches to enterprise planning: planning by task and planning by time. You
can manage both with Open ERP.

.. i18n: In planning by task, the project manager assigns tasks from the different projects to each employee
.. i18n: over a given period. Employees then carry out precisely the work they've been assigned by the
.. i18n: project manager.

In planning by task, the project manager assigns tasks from the different projects to each employee
over a given period. Employees then carry out precisely the work they've been assigned by the
project manager.

.. i18n: Planning by time consists of allocating, for each employee, some time on each of the different
.. i18n: projects for the period concerned. The tasks for each project are ordered by priority and can be
.. i18n: directly assigned to a user or left unassigned. Each employee then chooses the task that he or she
.. i18n: will do next, based on the plans and the relative priorities of the tasks.

.. i18n: 	.. note:: Comparing the two planning methods
.. i18n: 
.. i18n: 			To illustrate the difference between planning by time and planning by task, take the case of an
.. i18n: 			IT project that's estimated to be around six months of work. This project is managed by iterative
.. i18n: 			cycles of development of around a month and a presentation is made to the client at the end of
.. i18n: 			each cycle to track the progress of the project. At this meeting you plan what must be carried
.. i18n: 			out for the following month. At the end of the month the account manager for the project invoices
.. i18n: 			the client for the work done on the project.
.. i18n: 
.. i18n: 			Suppose that the project encounters a delay because it is more complex than expected. There are
.. i18n: 			two ways of resolving the delay if you have no further resources: you can be
.. i18n: 			
.. i18n: 			* late in your delivery of the planned functions, or 
.. i18n: 			
.. i18n: 			* on time, but with fewer functions than planned.
.. i18n: 
.. i18n: 			If your planning is based on phases and tasks you'll report at the client meeting that it will
.. i18n: 			take several weeks to complete everything that was planned for the current phase. Conversely, if
.. i18n: 			you're planning by time you'll keep the meeting with the client to close the present development
.. i18n: 			phase and plan the new one, but only be able to present part of the planned functionality.
.. i18n: 
.. i18n: 			If the client is sensitive to delay, the first approach will cause acute unhappiness. You'll have
.. i18n: 			to re-plan the project and all of its future phases to take account of that delay. Some problems
.. i18n: 			are also likely to occur later with invoicing, because it will be difficult for you to invoice
.. i18n: 			any work that has been completed late but hasn't yet been shown to the client.
.. i18n: 
.. i18n: 			The second approach will require you to report on the functions that haven't been completed, and
.. i18n: 			on how they would fit into a future planning phase. That won't involve a break in the
.. i18n: 			working time allocated to the project, however. 
.. i18n: 			You'd then generate two different lists: a staffing plan
.. i18n: 			for the different projects, and the list of tasks prioritized for the client's project. This
.. i18n: 			approach offers a number of advantages over the first one:
.. i18n: 
.. i18n: 			* The client will have the choice of delaying the end of the project by planning an extra phase,
.. i18n: 			  or letting go of some minor functions to be able to deliver a final system more rapidly,
.. i18n: 
.. i18n: 			* The client may re-plan the functions taking the new delay into account.
.. i18n: 
.. i18n: 			* You'll be able to make the client gradually aware of the fact that project progress has come
.. i18n: 			  under pressure and that work is perhaps more complex than had been estimated at the outset.
.. i18n: 
.. i18n: 			* A delay in the delivery of several of the functions won't necessarily affect either monthly
.. i18n: 			  invoicing or project planning.
.. i18n: 
.. i18n: 			Being able to separate human resource planning from task prioritization simplifies your
.. i18n: 			management of complex issues, such as adjusting for employee holidays or handling the constantly
.. i18n: 			changing priorities within projects.
