Analytic records
================

.. i18n: Just as in general accounting, analytic entries must belong to an account and an analytic journal.

Just as in general accounting, analytic entries must belong to an account and an analytic journal.

.. i18n: Analytic records can be distinguished from general records by the following characteristics:

Analytic records can be distinguished from general records by the following characteristics:

.. i18n: * they're not necessarily legal accounting documents,
.. i18n: 
.. i18n: * they don't necessarily belong to an existing accounting period,
.. i18n: 
.. i18n: * they're managed according to their date and not an accounting period,
.. i18n: 
.. i18n: * they don't generate both a debit and a credit entry, but a positive amount (income) or a negative
.. i18n:   amount (cost).

* they're not necessarily legal accounting documents,

* they don't necessarily belong to an existing accounting period,

* they're managed according to their date and not an accounting period,

* they don't generate both a debit and a credit entry, but a positive amount (income) or a negative

Automated entries

.. i18n: Analytic accounting is totally integrated with the other Open ERP modules, so you never have to re-
.. i18n: enter the records. They're automatically generated by the following operations:

Analytic accounting is totally integrated with the other Open ERP modules, so you never have to re-
enter the records. They're automatically generated by the following operations:

.. i18n: * confirmation of an invoice generates analytic entries for sales or purchases connected to the
.. i18n:   account shown in the invoice line,
.. i18n: 
.. i18n: * the entry of a service generates an analytic entry for the cost of this service to the given
.. i18n:   project,
.. i18n: 
.. i18n: * the manufacture of a product generates an entry for the manufacturing cost of each operation in
.. i18n:   the product range.

* confirmation of an invoice generates analytic entries for sales or purchases connected to the
  account shown in the invoice line,

* the entry of a service generates an analytic entry for the cost of this service to the given
  project,

* the manufacture of a product generates an entry for the manufacturing cost of each operation in
  the product range.

.. i18n: Other documents linked to one of these three operations produce analytic records indirectly. For
.. i18n: example, when you're entering a customer sales order you can link it to the customer's analytic
.. i18n: account. When you're managing by case or project, mark the project with that order. This order will
.. i18n: then generate a customer invoice, which will be linked to the analytic account. When the invoice is
.. i18n: validated it will automatically create general and analytic accounting records for the corresponding
.. i18n: project.

.. i18n: Expense receipts from an employee can be linked to an analytic account for reimbursement. When a
.. i18n: receipt is approved by the company, a purchase invoice is created. This invoice represents a debit
.. i18n: on the company in favor of the employee. Each line of the purchase invoice is then linked to an
.. i18n: analytic account which automatically allocates the costs for that receipt to the corresponding
.. i18n: project.
