     In managing stock, a gap between the data in the software and real quantities in stock is
     difficult to avoid.
     Double-entry stock management gives twice as many opportunities to find an error.
     If you forget two items of stock this error will automatically be reflected in the
     counterpart's location.

.. i18n: You can make a comparison with accounting, where you'll easily find an error because you can look
.. i18n: for an anomaly in an account or in the counterparts: if there's not enough in a bank account then that's
.. i18n: probably because someone's forgotten to enter a customer's invoice payment. You always know that the
