.. i18n: Another component of OpenObject - BI, enables application access to dimensional data using Web Services. This facility will allow applications to issue XML-based queries across a Web-based connection using XML-RPC. This support will be based more on XML query languages rather than on OLAP language.

.. i18n: By providing a flexible, platform-neutral way for rendering diverse data types, XML has become a standard for exchanging information across heterogeneous applications. Web services, a set of XML based protocols for finding and communicating between loosely-coupled, internet callable application "services" have therefore become the preferred mechanism for integrating heterogeneous applications and enabling service architectures.
