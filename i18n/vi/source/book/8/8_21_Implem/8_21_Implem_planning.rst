==================================

Open ERP is so easy to start using that it's not always obvious, particularly to IT staff, that a
clear requirements plan is necessary for implementing the system successfully. The difficulty isn't
particularly in installing the software nor in configuring it, but rather more about:

.. i18n: 
.. i18n: * deciding if you should adapt the software or perhaps change your method of working, for some of
.. i18n:   your specialized processes,

.. i18n: * ensuring that your users are committed to the change.

project rather than an IT project in itself. The challenge of this type of project is in changing
the behaviour of those involved at all levels of the enterprise.

.. i18n: People in the IT department will certainly be an integral part of the project but they should be
.. i18n: managed by someone in a senior position who both understands the business impact across the
.. i18n: organization and has experience of technical projects. Ideally the project manager should know the
.. i18n: company well, both its specific quirks and its different standard cross-company processes.

.. i18n: If the enterprise doesn't have its own IT group, you're probably better off opting for an SaaS
.. i18n: offer. This means that you subcontract all the difficult technology, from the installation of the
.. i18n: server to its maintenance, all the while being assured of the installation of a robust architecture
.. i18n: with its redundancy, backed-up servers, and separation of authentication and data.
