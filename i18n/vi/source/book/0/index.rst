.. i18n: Information Systems have played an increasingly visible role over the past several years in
.. i18n: improving the competitiveness of business.
.. i18n: More than just tools for handling repetitive tasks, they're used to guide and advance
.. i18n: all of a company's' daily activities. Integrated management software is today very often a
.. i18n: key source of significant competitive advantage.

Trong thập kỷ vừa qua, hệ thống thông tin (HTTT) ngày càng đóng vai trò quan trọng
trong việc nâng cao tính cạnh tranh của doanh nghiệp.
Không chỉ là công cụ để giải quyết các công việc lặp đi lặp lại, HTTT còn được sử dụng để hỗ trợ
mọi hoạt động hàng ngày của công ty. Ngày nay, phần mềm tích hợp quản lý có thể xem là một trong những
con át chủ bài để dành lấy lợi thế trên thương trường.

.. i18n: The standard response to a need for responsiveness, reliability, and rapidly
.. i18n: increasing expectations is to create an organization based on departments with
.. i18n: a clear linear structure, integrated around your operating processes.  To
.. i18n: increase efficiency amongst salespeople, accountants, logistics staff and
.. i18n: everyone else you should have a common understanding of your problems.

The standard response to a need for responsiveness, reliability, and rapidly
increasing expectations is to create an organization based on departments with
a clear linear structure, integrated around your operating processes.
Để tăng năng suất lao động của người bán hàng, kế toán, nhân viên hậu cần, ... chúng ta
cần phải có hiểu biết cơ bản về các vấn đề mà doanh nghiệp chúng ta đang mắc phải.

.. i18n: For this you need a common language for shared references, policies and communication.
.. i18n: An ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) system makes the ideal platform for this common reference
.. i18n: point.

Để đạt được điều đó, chúng ta cần một thứ ngôn ngữ chung trong tất cả các tài liệu, số liệu, báo cáo, kế hoạch.
Một hệ thống ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning, hoạch định tài nguyên doanh nghiệp) chính là thứ ngôn ngữ
mà chúng ta đang mong muốn.

.. i18n: Open Source software at the service of management
.. i18n: =================================================

Dịch vụ quản lý và phần mềm nguồn mở
=================================================

.. i18n: Risks and integration costs are important barriers to all the advantages you gain from such systems.
.. i18n: That's why, today, few small- and medium-sized companies use ERP.
.. i18n: In addition, the larger ERP vendors such as SAP, Microsoft and Oracle haven't been able
.. i18n: to reconcile the power and comprehensive cover of an ERP system with the simplicity and flexibility
.. i18n: wanted by the users.
.. i18n: But this is exactly what small and medium enterprises are looking for.

Rủi ro thất bại và chi phí triển khai là một rào cản lớn đối với doanh nghiệp trước khi họ nhận ra được lợi ích thật sự
từ những hệ thống như thế này.
Đó là lý do mà hiện nay, chỉ một số ít doanh nghiệp vừa và nhỏ sử dụng ERP.
Thêm vào đó, những nhà cung cấp ERP lớn như SAP, Microsoft và Oracle đã không thể dung hoà sức mạnh toàn diện của một hệ thống ERP với sự đơn giản và cơ động mà người dùng mong muốn.

.. i18n: The development processes of open source software, and the new business models adopted by their
.. i18n: developers,
.. i18n: provide a new way of resolving such problems of cost and quality for this kind of enterprise
.. i18n: software.

Quy trình phát triển phần mềm nguồn mở với những chức năng luôn được cập nhật từ thực tế doanh nghiệp
mở ra một hướng đi mới trong việc giải quyết bài toán chi phí và chất lượng cho những phần mềm doanh nghiệp này.

.. i18n: To make an ERP system fully available to small and medium enterprises, cost reduction is the first
.. i18n: priority.
.. i18n: Open source software makes it possible to greatly reduce development costs by
.. i18n: aggressive reuse of open source software libraries; to eliminate intermediaries (the distributors),
.. i18n: with all of their expensive sales overhead; to cut out selling costs by free publication of the
.. i18n: software;
.. i18n: and to considerably reduce the marketing overhead.

Để một hệ thống ERP có thể hoàn toàn nằm trong khả năng của các doanh nghiệp vừa và nhỏ, chi phí phải là ưu tiên số một.
Phần mềm nguồn mở giảm đáng kể các chi phí lập trình bằng cách tận dụng tối đa các thư viện phần mềm miễn phí có sẵn, hạn chế các quá trình trung gian. Mặt khác, phần mềm nguồn mở hoàn toàn không chịu ảnh hưởng của các chi phí marketing, bán hàng.

.. i18n: Since there is open interaction among thousands of contributors and partners working on the same
.. i18n: project,
.. i18n: the quality of the resulting software benefits greatly from the scrutiny.
.. i18n: And you can't be everything at once: accountant, software developer, salesperson,
.. i18n: ISO 9001 quality professional, specialist in agricultural products,
.. i18n: expert in the customs and habits of pharmaceutical vendors, just as a start.

Vì mỗi dự án phần mềm nguồn mở đề có được sự đóng góp của hàng nghìn người cùng làm việc
nên chất lượng sản phẩm luôn luôn ở mức làm hài lòng người dùng.
Dĩ nhiên chúng ta không phải là ngài Biết Tất: kế toán, lập trình viên, bán háng, chuyên gia kiểm định chất lượng (ISO 9001),
chuyên viên ngông nghiệp, giám đốc quan hệ khách hàng...

.. i18n: Faced with these wide-ranging requirements, what could be better than a world network of
.. i18n: partners and contributors?
.. i18n: Everyone adds their own contribution according to their professional competence.
.. i18n: Throughout this book you'll see that the results exceed any reasonable expectations when such work
.. i18n: is well organized.

Đối diện với những yêu cầu trải rộng như vậy, có gì hơn một mạng lưới những người đóng góp trên khắp thế giới?
Mỗi người góp một chút kiến thức và kinh nghiệm của họ, một giọt nước, chúng ta đã có một đại dương.
Đọc qua cuốn sách này, bạn sẽ thấy kết quả vượt qua mọi sự mong đợi trong việc tối ưu hoá cách quản lý doanh nghiệp.

.. i18n: But the real challenge of development is to make this solution simple and flexible, as well as
.. i18n: complete.
.. i18n: And to reach this level of quality you need a leader and co-ordinator who can organize all of these
.. i18n: activities.
.. i18n: So the development team of Tiny ERP, today called Open ERP, is responsible for most of
.. i18n: the organization, synchronization and coherence of the software.

Nhưng thử thách thật sự của việc phát triển một hệ thống như vậy chính là làm cách nào để nó vừa đơn giản và cơ động, lại vừa hoàn thiện.
Và để đạt được chất lượng cao, chúng ta cần những người lãnh đạo và các cộng sự có cái nhìn sâu rộng trong mọi vấn đề trên.
Vì vậy, nhóm phát triển Open ERP (trước kia là Tiny ERP), chịu trách nhiệm phần lớn công việc quản lý, đồng bộ hoá và định hướng phát triển phần mềm.

.. i18n: And Open ERP offers great performance in all these areas!

Và Open ERP sẽ đem lại những kết quả tuyệt với trong những lĩnh vực này!

.. i18n: The Open ERP Solution
.. i18n: =====================

Giải pháp của Open ERP
=====================

.. i18n: Because of its modularity, collaborative developments in Open ERP have been cleanly integrated,
.. i18n: enabling any company to choose from a large list of available functions.
.. i18n: As with most open source software, accessibility, flexibility, and simplicity are important keywords
.. i18n: for development.
.. i18n: Experience has shown that there's no need to train users for several months on the system,
.. i18n: because they can just download it and use it directly.

Được xây dựng theo hình thức lắp ghép module (modularity), việc phát triển Open ERP rất dễ dàng và nhanh chóng,
cho phép bất kỳ công ty nào lựa chọn các chức năng phù hợp với yêu cầu riêng từ một kho khổng lồ, với mỗi module tương ứng với một hoạt động trong công ty.
Cũng như đa số các phần mềm nguồn mở khác, tính thuận tiện, cơ động và đơn giản là những tiêu chuẩn quan trọng khi phát triển Open ERP.
Kinh nghiệm thực tế đã chứng minh rằng không cần phải tập huấn người dùng hàng tháng trời, đơn giản vì họ có thể tự tải nó về cà dùng trực tiếp.

.. i18n: So you'll find the modules for all types of needs, allowing your company to build its customized
.. i18n: system
.. i18n: by simply grouping and configuring the most suitable modules. Hundreds of modules are available.

Vậy nên bạn sẽ tìm được những module cho mọi yêu cầu của bạn, cho phép công ty có thể tự xây dựng một hệ thống đúng như yêu cầu bằng cách gộp các module lại với nhau rồi cấu hình cho phù hợp nhất với thực tế.
Có hơn 400 module sẵn sàng để sử dụng có thể tải về từ máy chủ của Open ERP, tính đến ngày |today|.

.. i18n: They range from specific modules like the EDI interface for agricultural products,
.. i18n: which has been used to interface with Match and Leclerc stores, up to the generic demonstration
.. i18n: automation
.. i18n: module for ordering sandwiches, which can take care of the eating preferences of your staff.

Nó gồm những module chuyên dụng, từ giao thức EDI (Electronic Data Interchange: Trao đổi dữ liệu điện tử) dùng cho nông phẩm,
được dùng để làm giao thức trảo đổi giữa 2 cửa hàng Match và Leclerc, đến module tự động hoá cho việc đặt bánh mì kẹp thịt, chức năng mà một ông chủ doanh nghiệp có thể sử dụng để đặt suất ăn trưa cho các nhân viên của mình.

.. i18n: The results are rather impressive. Open ERP (once called Tiny ERP when it started out) is management
.. i18n: software that is downloaded more than any other in the world, with over 600 downloads per day.
.. i18n: It's available today in 18 languages and has a world network of partners and contributors.
.. i18n: More than 800 developers participate in the projects on the collaborative development system of Tiny
.. i18n: Forge.

.. i18n: To our knowledge, Open ERP is the only management system which is routinely used not only by big
.. i18n: companies but also by very small companies and independent companies. This diversity is an

.. i18n: And this diversity is also found in the various sectors and trades which use the software, including
.. i18n: agricultural products, textiles, public auctions, IT, and trade associations.

.. i18n: Lastly, such software has arisen from the blend of high code quality, well-judged architecture and
.. i18n: use of free technologies. In fact, you may be surprised (if you're an IT person) to find that the
.. i18n: download size of Open ERP is only around 6 MB. When that's expanded during installation its size is mostly 
.. i18n: attributable to all the official translations that are packaged with it, not the operating code. 
.. i18n: We've moved a long way from
.. i18n: the days when the only people who could be expected to benefit from ERP were the owners of a widget
.. i18n: factory on some remote industrial estate.
