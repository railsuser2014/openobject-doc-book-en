Accounting is at the heart of managing a company: all the company's operations have an impact here.
It has an informational role (how much cash is there? what debts need to be repaid? what's the stock
valuation?) and, because of the information it provides, a reliable and detailed accounting system
can and should have a major decision-making role.

.. i18n: In most real companies, accounting is limited to producing statutory reports and satisfying the

.. i18n: income statement several times a year. Even then there's often several weeks of delay between

.. i18n:
