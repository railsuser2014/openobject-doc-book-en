MDX stands for Multidimensional Expressions. You use it to query OLAP databases. In a nutshell, MDX is to OLAP databases as SQL queries are to relational databases. 

.. i18n: OLAP databases primarily consist of OLAP cubes, which store fact tables, measures (such as sales, purchase, etc.) and dimensions/hierarchies. An OLAP database is often an aggregation of a relational database; as a result, you can write MDX queries to retrieve key calculations that measure company performance, often with less code than standard SQL.

.. i18n: Because of the nature of OLAP databases, we need to write MDX code to retrieve data in far fewer lines of code than would be required using SQL. This is a segue into the role that OLAP databases and MDX play in the world of business intelligence.

.. i18n: The dimensional meta data facility addresses the issue that although this application store dimensional data in relational tables (usually in the form of fact and dimension tables), the user doesnot have to worry for database not aware of the dimensionality, or OLAP semantics, of this data. It provides a comprehensive meta data facility to define these semantics and an XML capability to enable meta data interchange with other external OLAP products.

.. i18n: It supports connectivity with most of the leading Databases programs.

It supports connectivity with most of the leading Databases programs.

.. i18n: Just a compatible Dialect and valid connection parameters is all that is needed to use a database.

Just a compatible Dialect and valid connection parameters is all that is needed to use a database.

.. i18n: The Dialect is used to describe how to talk to a specific kind of database. Dialects are included with SQLAlchemy for SQLite, Postgres, MySQL, MS-SQL, Firebird, Informix, and Oracle; these can be described as Python modules present in the sqlalchemy.databases package. Each dialect requires the appropriate DBAPI drivers to be installed separately.
