	So in addition to the cases handled here, you could obtain calendars of tasks, deliveries,

.. i18n: 			you can see that most cases were closed in less than two days, but some may take more than ten
.. i18n: 			days.
.. i18n: 
.. i18n: 			If you think that the quality of service should be improved you can automate certain actions. You
.. i18n: 			could send copies of the discussion to a technical expert if the case remains open for longer
.. i18n: 			than two days, defined by the following rule:
.. i18n: 
.. i18n: 			* :guilabel:`Rule Name` : Copy to an expert after 2 days,

.. i18n: 
.. i18n: 			After the rule has been defined, the expert will receive a copy of the whole discussion between
.. i18n: 			the Demo User and the customer for every case that remains unclosed after two days. He'll be able
.. i18n: 			to interact with the discussion to avoid lengthy delays on complex problems.
.. i18n: 
.. i18n: 			Some companies use several support levels. The first level is handled by the least qualified
.. i18n: 			support people and the higher levels by users who have the advantage of more experience. A user
.. i18n: 			on level 1 can escalate the case to a higher level when necessary.
.. i18n: 
.. i18n: 			To systematically train employees at level 1 you can create the following rule: when the case has
.. i18n: 			been escalated they will continue to be copied on the progress of the case. If a user at support
.. i18n: 			level 1 can't handle a request he can escalate it to level 2. Then when an expert at level 2
.. i18n: 			answers the customer's request, the level 1 support person also receives the answer to the
.. i18n: 			problem that he couldn't originally handle. So your team can be educated automatically from
.. i18n: 			listening in to the passage of live support calls.
.. i18n: 
.. i18n: 			Suppose that you supply two types of support contract to your customers: Gold and Normal. You can
.. i18n: 			then create a rule which raises the priority of a case automatically if the partner is in the

.. i18n: 
.. i18n: 			Improved client relations can flow from using such rules intelligently. With the statistical
.. i18n: 			control system you can manage certain SLAs (Service Level Agreements) with your customers without
.. i18n: 			a great deal of effort on your part. So you can be selective in replying to those of your
.. i18n: 			partners based on the specific quality of service that you are contracted to supply.
.. i18n: 
.. i18n: 	.. note::  *Example 2 Tracking supplier quality*
.. i18n: 
.. i18n: 			Remember that an Open ERP partner can be a supplier as much as a customer. You can use the same

.. i18n: 
.. i18n: 			If any of your staff detect a quality problem with a product from a supplier they should create a
.. i18n: 			new case in the Quality section. If the email gateway is installed all you need to do is copy an
.. i18n: 			email to a specified address (for example complaints@mycompany.com) while sending your email of
.. i18n: 			complaint to the supplier. The case is automatically created in Open ERP and the supplier's
.. i18n: 			email response will close the case and be placed automatically in the case history.
.. i18n: 
.. i18n: 			In this case the user can add corrective or preventative actions to conform to ISO 9001, without

.. tip:: Identifying a resource

	Each resource on the Open ERP system has a unique identifier number. This corresponds to an
	identifier in the underlying PostgreSQL database table, in the ID column for that resource.

	With the web client you can usually find this number by going to the form view of a resource and
	clicking the :guilabel:`View Log` button to the top right of the form. The ID is shown at the top
	of the :guilabel:`Information` dialog box. (This didn't work in some of the earlier versions prior to 4.2.3.3.)
