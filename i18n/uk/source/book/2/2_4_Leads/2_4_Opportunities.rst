Sales Opportunities
===================

.. i18n: While a lead represents the first contact with a prospect yet to be qualified, a sales opportunity
.. i18n: represents a potential contract. Each opportunity must be followed up by a salesperson spending time
.. i18n: to make a quotation or the cancellation of the opportunity.

While a lead represents the first contact with a prospect yet to be qualified, a sales opportunity
represents a potential contract. Each opportunity must be followed up by a salesperson spending time
to make a quotation or the cancellation of the opportunity.

.. i18n: Leads are generally handled en masse, with the automation of certain responses or emails. 
.. i18n: Opportunities, in contrast, are usually tracked one by one by the salespeople because that involves
.. i18n: a process of negotiation.

Just like leads, Open ERP provides several menus to handle sales opportunities efficiently. All
the menus for opportunities are under the menu :menuselection:`CRM & SRM --> Sales -->
Opportunities`.

.. i18n: To quickly create a new opportunity, use the menu :menuselection:`CRM & SRM --> Sales --> Opportunities --> New Opportunity`.
.. i18n: You usually use this menu in the case where the opportunity is direct and doesn't come first from a
.. i18n: lead. It can also be useful to create a shortcut to this menu so that you can quickly open a new
.. i18n: opportunity form when you need to – after a phone call, or an email, that needs followup.
