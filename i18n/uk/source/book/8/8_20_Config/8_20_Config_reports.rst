.. i18n: Open ERP has two distinct report types:

Open ERP has two distinct report types:

.. i18n: * Statistical reports: these are calculated data, often represented in the form of lists or graphs.
.. i18n:   These reports are dynamic and you can navigate through the data that comprise the figures through
.. i18n:   the client interface.
.. i18n: 
.. i18n: * Report documents: they're used to print system documents. The result is usually a PDF generated by
.. i18n:   a selection made on the screen. Furthermore, Open ERP enables you to open these reports in
.. i18n:   OpenOffice.org to edit in any changes you want before sending them to your customer.

Creating common headers for reports

When saving new reports and reports that you've modified, you're given the option to select a
header. This header is a template that creates a standard page header and footer containing data
that's defined in each database.

.. i18n: The header is available to all users of the Open ERP server. Its template can be found on the file
.. i18n: system of the server in the directory  \ ``addons/custom``\   and is common to all the users of the
.. i18n: server. Although reports attach information about the company that's printing them you can replace
.. i18n: various names in the template with values from the database, but the layout of the page will stay
.. i18n: common to all databases on the server.

.. i18n: Then go to the \ ``addons/custom``\  directory, copy your logo across (in a standard graphical file
.. i18n: format), then edit the file \ ``corporate_rml_header.rml``\   in a text editor. Text in the form \
.. i18n: ``<image file="corporate_logo.png" x="1cm" y="27.4cm" width="6cm"/>``\  should be put after the line
.. i18n: \ ``<!--logo-->``\   to pick up and display your logo on each page that uses the corporate header.
