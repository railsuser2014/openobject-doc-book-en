.. i18n: In summary, you should arrange both user training and self-paced training (perhaps based on this
.. i18n: book series) if you can. Technical training is strongly advised if you see yourselves developing your own
.. i18n: modules. Although it's not obligatory it gives you quite a time advantage in any serious Open ERP
.. i18n: engagement.
