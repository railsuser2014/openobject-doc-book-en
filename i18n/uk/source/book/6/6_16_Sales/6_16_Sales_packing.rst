Management of Packaging
=======================

Products can be managed in several different packaged forms. For example if you sell
batteries you can define the following packages for a given battery product:

.. i18n: * by Piece: a battery
.. i18n: 
.. i18n: * Blister pack: a pack of 4 batteries
.. i18n: 
.. i18n: * Pack of 100 blisters: 400 batteries
.. i18n: 
.. i18n: * Palette, containing 40 packs for a total of 16,000 batteries.

* by Piece: a battery

* Blister pack: a pack of 4 batteries

* Pack of 100 blisters: 400 batteries

* Palette, containing 40 packs for a total of 16,000 batteries.

.. i18n: Open ERP's packaging management enables you to sell the same product in several different forms. The
.. i18n: salesperson could sell, separately, one battery or a palette of batteries. In the order, you can
.. i18n: select the default packaging type as a function of the quantities ordered.

Open ERP's packaging management enables you to sell the same product in several different forms. The
salesperson could sell, separately, one battery or a palette of batteries. In the order, you can
select the default packaging type as a function of the quantities ordered.

.. i18n: For example, if the customer wants to buy 30,000 batteries, the salesperson can select the package
.. i18n: ``palette`` . Open ERP will then propose the sale of 32,000 batteries, which corresponds to two
.. i18n: palettes. Or the salesperson can select 75 packs.

For example, if the customer wants to buy 30,000 batteries, the salesperson can select the package
``palette`` . Open ERP will then propose the sale of 32,000 batteries, which corresponds to two
palettes. Or the salesperson can select 75 packs.

.. i18n: The available packages are defined in the product form, in the :guilabel:`Packaging` tab. The first item on the
.. i18n: list is the one that will be used by default.

The available packages are defined in the product form, in the :guilabel:`Packaging` tab. The first item on the
list is the one that will be used by default.

.. i18n: Once a package has been defined on the order, Open ERP will throw up an alert if the ordered
.. i18n: quantities don't correspond to the proposed packages. The quantity must be a multiple of the field
.. i18n: :guilabel:`Quantity by Package` defined on the packaging form.

Once a package has been defined on the order, Open ERP will throw up an alert if the ordered
quantities don't correspond to the proposed packages. The quantity must be a multiple of the field
:guilabel:`Quantity by Package` defined on the packaging form.

.. i18n: Don't confuse the management of packaging with the management of multiple units of measure. The
.. i18n: Units of Measure are used to manage the stock differently in its different units. 
.. i18n: With packages, the stock is always managed by individual item but information about the package to use is supplied
.. i18n: to the storesperson along with that item.

Don't confuse the management of packaging with the management of multiple units of measure. The
Units of Measure are used to manage the stock differently in its different units. 
With packages, the stock is always managed by individual item but information about the package to use is supplied
to the storesperson along with that item.

.. i18n: Even if the effects are the same, the printed documents will be different. The two following
.. i18n: operations have the same effect on stock movement levels but will be printed differently
.. i18n: on the sales order and the packing order:

Even if the effects are the same, the printed documents will be different. The two following
operations have the same effect on stock movement levels but will be printed differently
on the sales order and the packing order:

.. i18n: * 32,000 batteries, delivered on two palettes,
.. i18n: 
.. i18n: * 2 palettes of batteries, with no information about packaging.

* 32,000 batteries, delivered on two palettes,

* 2 palettes of batteries, with no information about packaging.

.. i18n: If the customer wants to order a palette and 10 packs, the salesperson can put two order
.. i18n: lines on the sales order using the same product but different units of measure.

If the customer wants to order a palette and 10 packs, the salesperson can put two order
lines on the sales order using the same product but different units of measure.

Example Packing and different products
--------------------------------------

.. i18n: It's sometimes more useful to define different products than to define several possible packages for
.. i18n: the same product. A case of beer in a supermarket is a good example. A case holds 24 bottles, plus
.. i18n: the empty case itself. The customer can buy bottles by the piece or a case of 24 bottles at one go.

It's sometimes more useful to define different products than to define several possible packages for
the same product. A case of beer in a supermarket is a good example. A case holds 24 bottles, plus
the empty case itself. The customer can buy bottles by the piece or a case of 24 bottles at one go.

.. i18n: You could define two packages for the product ``Bottle of beer`` : ``PCE`` and ``case`` . But this
.. i18n: representation doesn't let you manage the stock and price of empty cases. So you might instead
.. i18n: prefer a Bill of Materials for the sale, defining and using three different products:

You could define two packages for the product ``Bottle of beer`` : ``PCE`` and ``case`` . But this
representation doesn't let you manage the stock and price of empty cases. So you might instead
prefer a Bill of Materials for the sale, defining and using three different products:

.. i18n: * the empty case for the beer,
.. i18n: 
.. i18n: * the bottle of beer,
.. i18n: 
.. i18n: * the case of 24 bottles of beer.

* the empty case for the beer,

* the bottle of beer,

* the case of 24 bottles of beer.

.. i18n: You also define the bill of materials below which determines the make-up of the case of 24 beers:

You also define the bill of materials below which determines the make-up of the case of 24 beers:

.. i18n: * Case of 24 bottles of beer: 1 unit,
.. i18n: 
.. i18n: * Bottle of beer: 24 units,
.. i18n: 
.. i18n: * Empty case of beer: 1 unit.

* Case of 24 bottles of beer: 1 unit,

* Bottle of beer: 24 units,

* Empty case of beer: 1 unit.

.. i18n: Each of these three products has a different price. The products ``Bottle of beer`` and ``Empty case of
.. i18n: beer`` have a stock level that needs to be managed. The ``Case of 24 bottles of beer`` has no stock because, 
.. i18n: if you sell the product, Open ERP automatically moves the stock in two lines, one for the empty case and the
.. i18n: other for the 24 individual bottles of beer. For more information on bills of material for sale,
.. i18n: see chapter :ref:`ch-mnf`.
