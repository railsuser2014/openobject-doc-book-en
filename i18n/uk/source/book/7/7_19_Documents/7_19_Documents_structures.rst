You now have a configuration that enables you to automatically get a directory structure linke to
Open ERP for each resource, such as for projects and orders. The ideal situation would now be to
automatically structure the documents about projects, say. For example, you could classify them
depending on their type:

.. i18n: * Quotations,
.. i18n: 
.. i18n: * Meeting Minutes,
.. i18n: 
.. i18n: * Delivery Documents,
.. i18n: 
.. i18n: * Documentation.

* Quotations,

* Meeting Minutes,

* Delivery Documents,

* Documentation.

.. i18n: Open ERP provides you with a system that lets you create a structure type for each type of a given
.. i18n: document. It then provides that classification for all documents in the directories structured in
.. i18n: that type.

Open ERP provides you with a system that lets you create a structure type for each type of a given
document. It then provides that classification for all documents in the directories structured in
that type.

.. i18n: So create the structure above for your project management system. To do that, create the four
.. i18n: directories above and give them the following data:

So create the structure above for your project management system. To do that, create the four
directories above and give them the following data:

.. i18n: * **Linked Model** : Analytic Account.

* **Type** : Static Directory,

* **Linked Model** : Analytic Account.

.. i18n: Then in each project (represented by analytic accounts) you'll get this substructure for

.. i18n: .. tip:: Mapping
.. i18n: 
.. i18n:     In practice, Open ERP doesn't create directories or files for every resource.
.. i18n:     It actually manages this by mapping between Open ERP resources and the FTP interface
.. i18n: 
.. i18n:     This approach gives a lot of flexibility because there's no synchronizing to do, nor any redundancy.
.. i18n:     Changes in either the document management system or in Open ERP will automatically be reflected
.. i18n:     over in the other side.
.. i18n: 
.. i18n:     And system resources are obviously not used up by storing things twice.
