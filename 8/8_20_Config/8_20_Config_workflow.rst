Configuring Workflows and Processes
===================================

Workflows represent the company's different document flows. They are completely configurable and
define the path that any individual OpenERP object (such as an order) must follow, depending on the conditions
(for example, an order above a certain value must be approved by a sales director, otherwise by any
sales person, before the delivery can be triggered).

The figure :ref:`fig-sflow` shows the standard workflow for an order. You can show it from the Debug Mode by clicking `Print Workflow`. Select an
order, then Print Workflow to show the workflow below.

The chapter :ref:`ch-process` provides all of the information
needed to create and modify technical workflows and cross-company processes.
