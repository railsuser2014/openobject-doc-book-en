Creating a Configuration Module
===============================

It is very helpful to be able to backup your specific configuration settings in an OpenERP module
dedicated just to that. This enables you to:

* automatically duplicate the configuration settings by installing the module in another database,

* reinstall a clean database with your own configuration, in case you have problems with the initial
  configuration,

* simplify migrations. If you have modified some elements of the basic configuration, there is a risk
  in returning them to their original state after the migration, unless you have saved the modifications
  in a module.

Start by installing the module :mod:`base_module_record` in the usual way from
:menuselection:`Administration --> Modules --> Modules`. Manually make all your
configuration changes through the user
interface as you would normally do (such as menu management, dashboard assignments, screen
configuration, new reports, and access rights management – details of some of these possibilities
are described later in this chapter).

Then start recording
your data using the menu :menuselection:`Administration --> Customization --> Module Creation -->
Export Customizations As a Module`. This opens a wizard through which you may select the date to record
from, choose records that have been \ ``Created`` \, \ ``Modified`` \ or both \ ``Created & Modified`` \.
You have to select the objects for recording and then start recording by clicking :guilabel:`Record`.
After the recording operation is complete, a dialog box appears giving you the opportunity to save
the recorded module at a desired location.

OpenERP then creates a ZIP file for you containing all of the modifications you made while you
were carrying out your configuration work. You could reinstall this module on other databases.
This could turn out to be useful if you want to install a
test server for your company's users and give them the same configuration as the production server.

To install a new module saved in ZIP file form, use the menu :menuselection:`Administration -->
Modules --> Import Module`.
