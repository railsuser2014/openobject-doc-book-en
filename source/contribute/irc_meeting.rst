Once a month, we will organize a community IRC meeting. All topics related to
the community, the Open ERP product, the Open Object project can be discussed

The phases of the meeting
+++++++++++++++++++++++++

Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~

At the beginning of each meeting, we will select:
* A responsible to organize and respect the list of topics
* Someone to write a summary during the meeting
These two people are publicly announced.

Then, the responsible of the meeting provide 2 links to be read:
* This page: that explains the meeting organization,
* The page containing the proposition of topics.

Then, we ask if someone wants to add some topics in the proposed list. If yes,
the different elements are added in the list of topics, in the right section.


Presentations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

People can write their names and the company they work for.

Discussion on topics
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The responsible of the meeting announces the topics one by one. Each new topics
should be emphasized so that it's clear when we read the logs:

* ---- New TOPIC ----

It's important to discuss ONLY about the current topic to keep a clean
structure in the meeting organisation. The responsible is the one that
should organisze the discussion, by asking people to wait the right
topic to discuss on some points.

Topics can not be longer than 15 minuts. If a topics is too long, the
responsible of the meeting can request to continue on the next topic and,
if needed, ask a new date to discuss this topic specifically.

Conclusion
~~~~~~~~~~

The responsible to write the summary copy/paste his summary in the IRC
channel. The summary must contain in minimum:
* List of assigned tasks (who do what)
* List of points to discuss in next meeting

People can criticise this summary, if the responsible missed some points.

The summary should not contain the thoughts or the full discussion of the
people, the IRC log is accessible for this.


Summary Post
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The responsible of the summary writes a post in the planet with the summary
of the IRC meeting.
