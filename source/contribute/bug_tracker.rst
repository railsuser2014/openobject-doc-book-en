Bug Tracker
-----------

We use launchpad on the openobject project to track all bugs and features
request related to openerp and openobject. the bug tracker is available here:

  * Bug Tracker : https://bugs.launchpad.net/openobject
  * Ideas Tracker : https://blueprints.launchpad.net/openobject
  * FAQ Manager : https://answers.launchpad.net/openobject

Every contributor can report bug and propose bugfixes for the bugs.
The status of the bug is set according to the correction.

When a particular branch fixes the bug, a commiter (member of the `Commiter
Team <https://launchpad.net/~openerp-commiter>`_) can set the status to "Fix
Commited". Only commiters have the right to change the status to "Fix
Committed.", after they validated the proposed patch or branch that fixes the
bug.

The `Quality Team <https://launchpad.net/~openerp>`_ have a look every day to
bugs in the status "Fix Commited". They check the quality of the code and merge
in the official branch if it's ok. To limit the work of the quality team, it's
important that only commiters can set the bug in the status "Fix Commited".
Once quality team finish merging, they change the status to "Fix Released".
