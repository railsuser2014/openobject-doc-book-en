What are the planets ?
++++++++++++++++++++++

The planets are the place where partners, developers and contributors express
themselves about the Open Object project. It's an aggregate of the personnal blogs
of partners and contributors. We use them to announce new developments,
features and events on Open ERP and Open Object.

We have two planets:

* Open Object, the community planet : http://openobject.com/planet
* Open ERP, the editor planet : http://openerp.com/planet

Every Open ERP contributor can post blogs on the Open Object planet, if you
follow the writing guidelines. See the section bellow to subscribe.

Our marketing and editorial team will review the Open Object planet frequently.
When they notice good announcement, they will write a good announce and publish
on the Open ERP planet. If the new feature is very good, we may also write
a press announce based on our article.


Writing Guidelines
++++++++++++++++++

To post on the Open Object planet, you must:

* Create a personnal blog
* Subscribe your blog on the planet by sending an email to fp AT openerp.com
* Write blogs and attach the label "openobject" to your posts

Some rules to follow:

* All blog entries to be published in the planet must be in english
* Announce only new events, new features or new developments
* Promote the work you did primarily, not the company you represent
* Only write positive messages, not negatives ones
* Avoid commercial messages in the planet. The only accepted commercial messages
  accepted are those from partners that announce trainings, exhibitions or
  conferences.

If you don't follow these rules, we may remove you from the planet.
