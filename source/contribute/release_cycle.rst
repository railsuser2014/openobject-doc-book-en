Explanation of the Versions
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The development of OpenERP follows two distinct branches:

  * Stable: a new version is published every year. This version is intended to
    be put in production, only bugfixes are applied in this version.
  * Development (sometimes called the trunk): It will contain all the latest
    functionalities and modules. It is intended for testing purpose only, until
    it is stabilized as the next stable version.
