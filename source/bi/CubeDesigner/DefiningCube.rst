Defining Cube
===========

Cube as we discussed in :ref:`The Cube <cube-link>` 

For making the cube we need

#. Cube Name : Meaningfull name for the cube 
#. :ref:`Schema <schema-link>`: :ref:`Configuring Schema <schema_configuration-link>`
#. Query Logging : It will decides whether the query will be logged or not.
#. Fact Table : A table that contains the facts (measures) and the link to the other tables that in turn qualifies for the dimensions. The fact table can be a join of two or more tables.

For example : 
To analysing the sales data we will take join of sale_order and sale_order_line as a fact table.

So we start making the cube. The screen shows the new cube window. The schema name will be filled by default depending on the schema we are browsing in the tree. The initial winodw will show the relational column for fact table which will open the search box of all the fact  table created so far.

We go for creating the new fact table. In the relational column it will show all the primary keys for all the table loaded in the introspection. 
We select sale_order_line table with primary key id. Once we are done with the selection we will go for joining the table.

Join Table will open all the tables that are referenced from the sale_order_line, according to the table name from the relational column. We select order_id as it is the field related to the sale_order. Hence, we made the join of the sale_order_line and sale_order

If we want more table to be joined we can do that by adding more on Join Tables. Now the search will be on all the reference from sale_order and sale_order_line

Finally the cube page will look like
