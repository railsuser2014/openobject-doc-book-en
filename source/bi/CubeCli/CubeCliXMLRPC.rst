WebService Interface
--------------------

Another component of OpenObject - BI, enables application access to dimensional data using Web Services. This facility will allow applications to issue XML-based queries across a Web-based connection using XML-RPC. This support will be based more on XML query languages rather than on OLAP language. 

By providing a flexible, platform-neutral way for rendering diverse data types, XML has become a standard for exchanging information across heterogeneous applications. Web services, a set of XML based protocols for finding and communicating between loosely-coupled, internet callable application "services" have therefore become the preferred mechanism for integrating heterogeneous applications and enabling service architectures. 

Emphasising on XML and Web services for data exchange and integration provides significant IT benefits including flexibility, interoperability and reach.
