Cube Browser
============

Cube Browser of Open Object-BI Platforme, aims at allowing user to design his own Reports through a clean and effective Web-based environment. 

It provides user with a friendly layer to create MDX Query on his previously designed OLAP Cubes with just few mouse operations, and retrieve the desired information in a comprehensible tabular layout. He can further re-format the layout, to drill to fetch further fine information and easily analyze it to understand business currents and causes. 

And if they don't require the full power of query capabilities, users can simply explore information in existing reportsâ€”formatting and interacting with data to meet his reporting needs.

Goal behind Cube Browser
========================

Provide user with a thin client to make reporting far more efficient. 
Let user use full power of MDXAlchemy engine. 
Wrapping the process of designing queries into a lot easier steps like clicks, drags and drops. 
Keeping the interface as simple yet powerful reporting tool.
