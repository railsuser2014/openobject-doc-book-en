Defining Schema in XML
======================

.. describe:: Why XML for Schema?


* XML is a meta language used to describe the structure and content of documents. 

* XML, although originally a document markup language, is increasingly used for data exchange on the Web. 

* The application of XML as a standard exchange format for data available on the Web makes it attractive to use in conjunction with OLAP tools.

* An XML document has both structure and content, and XML provides a means for separating one from the other in the electronic document. 

* The structure of a document is given by use of matching tag pairs (termed an element) and the information between matching tags is referred to as the content of the element. Furthermore, an element is permitted to have additional attributes, where values are assigned to the attributes in the start tag of the element.

* XML documents can also contain a description of their logical structure, which is called a document type definition (DTD). A DTD is a context free grammar defining, in terms of element content specifications, all allowable elements,their attributes, and the elements nesting structure. Given a DTD it can be verified that an XML document conforms to the DTD, and if so, the XML document is said to be valid.


So all these features make XML a attracted language to make use of it in making a schema.
