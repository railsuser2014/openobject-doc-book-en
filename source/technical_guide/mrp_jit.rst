Description
-----------

::

  This module allows Just In Time computation of all procurement.
  
      If you install this module, you will not have to run the schedulers anymore.
      Each document is computed in real time. Note that this module can slow down your
      system a little bit.
  
      It may also increase your stock size because products are reserved as soon
      as possible. In that case, you can not use priorities any more on the different
      picking.
