Description
-----------

::

  This module offer a growing collection of objects to create simple and advanced reports in a new way of doing.
  	               You can create powerful reports with a few lines of python code and nothing else. (no sxw, rml or xml)
  				   This module follow multiple goals: 
  				     - To accelerate report creation by creating reusable pieces of code (one line of code to create standard header and footer)
  				     - To accelerate report generation (processing) by getting ride of uncecessary parsing and transformations (direct python to pdf generation) 
  				     - To improve reporting capabilities by getting ride of uncomplete parsers and limited middle technologies 
  				     - To make reports designs more uniform 
  				   
  				   For exemples of use, have a look at c2c_planning_management. Our first module based on this tool.
