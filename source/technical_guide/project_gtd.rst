Description
-----------

::

  This module implements all concepts defined by the Getting Things Done
  methodology. This world-wide used methodology is used for personal
  time management improvement.
  
  Getting Things Done (commonly abbreviated as GTD) is an action management
  method created by David Allen, and described in a book of the same name.
  
  GTD rests on the principle that a person needs to move tasks out of the mind by
  recording them externally. That way, the mind is freed from the job of
  remembering everything that needs to be done, and can concentrate on actually
  performing those tasks.
