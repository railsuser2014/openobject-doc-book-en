Description
-----------

::
  
    
          This module allows you to manage entirely your contacts.
  
      It lets you define
          *contacts unrelated to a partner,
          *contacts working at several addresses (possibly for different partners),
          *contacts with possibly different functions for each of its job's addresses
  
      It also add new menu items located in
          Partners \ Contacts
          Partners \ Functions
  
      Pay attention that this module converts the existing addresses into "addresses + contacts". It means that some fields of the addresses will be missing (like the contact name), since these are supposed to be defined in an other object.
