Description

::

  Product Decay
  the goal of this module, is to estimate the average price of the remaining product stock using the following assertions:
  - the remaining stock is based on the invoiced products only (from purchases and sales)
  - everything happen like if we sale first the more expensive remaining products
  
  So it's a bit like FIFO (if prices were always falling it would look like FIFO) but it's certainly not a
  legal way of valuing your stocks.
  
  Actually this module only gives you an indicative price that you could base your sale margin upon, so that:
  - you always ensure a given margin
  - you make sure your sale price will follow the market, meaning decay hopefully
