OpenERP Client Installation for Windows
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

The Windows client installation is very simple. There are 6 stages :

   1. Welcome message.
   2. GPL Licence Acceptation
   3. Shortcut in the Start menu.
   4. Creation of a 'Start' icon on the desktop
   5. Confirmation Choices
   6. Automatic installation

You have to install, configure and run the Open ERP Server before using the
Open ERP Client. The client needs the server to run. You can install the server
application on your computer, or on an independent server accessible by
network.

.. note::

  For further information on how to install the server, please take look at
  :ref:`OpenERP Server Installation
