The NotSoTiny Company
*********************

The NotSoTiny factory is located in Ayze, near Annecy in France and it
manufactures wooden bookshelves as shown in the above figure.

La société a été fondée en 1978 par deux associés: Fabien Dupont et Luc
Lecoq.

* Fabien Dupont, l'actuel directeur général, a un parcours professionel
  plutôt technique et est responsable des grandes innovations qui ont fait la
  renommée de NotSoTiny.
* Luc Lecoq, le vice-président, a un profil plutôt financier et commercial.
  Il a fondé NotSoTiny, après plusieurs années d'expériences dans un grand
  cabinets de consultants français. Il a permi à NotSoTiny de décrocher des
  contrats importants qui ont poussé l'entreprise dans sa croissance.

NotSoTiny compte aujourd'hui 80 collaborateurs et s'est forgé une place de
leader français dans son domaine. Un positionnement stratégique sur le marché
a permi à la société de se distinguer des concurrents:

* Une gamme de produits assez réduite mais de haute qualité, principalement
  orienté autour de deux modèles d'armoires. Ceci a permi d'industrialiser la
  chaine de fabrication à un très haut niveau afin d'avoir un coût de production
  très compétitif.
* Un bureau d'étude et de conception proposant des projets d'études, sur
  mesure, pour particuliers et entreprises.

The Open ERP Project
====================

As NotSoTiny had a fast growth these past 5 years, it is now in a situation where
all the processes are complex and requires a lot of efforts for the employees: dual
encoding, error in processes, several non-integrated softwares.

NotSoTiny organized an internal group the manage the ERP project and selection. After
having spent threee months to evaluate all the ERP softwares on the market, they
decided to go for Open ERP, which seems to be far more advanced than all others
competitors.

As to limit the risk of doing a big integration project at once, they contacted
you to build a fully functionnal prototype based on their own data. You will have
five days to build a clean configuration of Open ERP to organise the workshops
and prototypes on Open ERP.

After a first meeting with the NotSoTiny ERP project managers, you agreed to
build the following prototype.

You have 5 days to setup the Open ERP system and organise workshops with the
different users of NotSoTiny. If you succeed to run a good prototype for
NotSoTiny, they will buy you the full integration project within the next 2
months.
