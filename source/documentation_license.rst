FAQ about documentation Licence
===============================

Why not using a free documentation licence ?
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

To achieve a very good quality of the documentation, we should manage it as
a real publisher process, with quality reviews by the editor. We also think
that the documentation is worth to be spread in bookstores as printed paper
based versions. It gives a very good world-wide visibility on the product.

When working with professional editors, like Eyrolles, they ask for some
copyrights on the (translated) content so that they can easily invest in
mass printing and distribution of the book. To take this risk, they need
some protections on versions of the book that are not compatible with the
GFPL.


Do you accept everyone to modify the book ?
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Our goal is to accept most of the contributions and contributors. So we provide
written authorisation if you contribute significantly.

But we must keep into the control of the book content to ensure:
* Editors rights are not enfridged
* Incentives like paid authors/translators rights are not enfridged

The erratas section is public on the wiki. Everyone can contribute in this
section. Then, the author can review proposals of modifications and apply in
his own way.

Why is this a good approach ?
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The documentation of OpenERP is one of our biggest priorities. We currently
have the best documentation amongst all open source ERP but it's not enough and
I am sure we can do much more better.

** Writing a Good Documentation is Complex **

For Years, we have try to make a community based documentation on a wiki where
everyone contribute. With OpenERP, we have a strong community but, after years,
the community documentation does not reached our expectations:

* Deprecated compared to new versions of the software,
* Original authors do no maintains what they write / contribute,
* Seems like if we assembled different pieces of unrelated documentations,
* Sometimes contributions comes from people that do not understand perfectly the software,
* Not end-user oriented,
* Some have experience only in food industries, others services companies, others manufacturing, eso.

As a result, we decided to review the way we will write and maintain futur
documentations about OpenERP and OpenObject.

** The New Process **

Most of the best open source documentations have been fully written in one try
by only one or two people / author. After that, the community improved the
content with small improvements from here to there.

So I think we'd better have to focus our ressources on some good individuals
rather than a global community. But writting a complete documentation (or a
complete chapter) can take a long time (we took about 200 hours to write the
OpenERP book in french, 280 pages). So we need incentives as to motivate these
contributors / authors.

So, we decided to manage all documentations about OpenERP through like real
books edition. We will setup a real editing chain with the following actors:

* The editors: will work with authors to review the quality of the book and will distribute in a range of countries through webshops and real bookstores. The editor also define authors contracts and the graphical charts and style. He will manage the collections (set of books).
* The authors: everyone can write his own chapter(s) and propose them to the editor. The editor will make a selection of chapters to publish complete books.
* Re-Readers: will re-read books before publication and work with the editor to achieve a high level of quality.
* Translators: will translate a particular book to their mother tongue based on the english version.

Editors will be different according to the coutries/translations of the book.
For all french countries, we already contracted our preceeding books with
Eyrolles. For the english version, we will create our own edition company as to
keep the rights on the text to be able to publish it online for free.

Now, we have our incentives for authors and translators:

* Getting a monthly revenue through author rights based on monthly sales,
* Being published in bookstores with our worldwide distribution channel.

Having established that, this should leverage individuals effort and promote
contributions on writing good documentation. As people will be published and
paid for their good work, this should promote new authors and translators.

Books are sold in bookstores in different countries and languages, this allow
us to remunerate the full edition chain through author rights. It will help us
to motivate authors and translators to write more chapters, and improve
existing ones.

We had to find a good middle point between selling through bookstores to
remunerate authors and publishing online to provide a free version. So, most of
our books (depending on the contract we have with the editor in the related
country), will be published online some months after their official
publication.

Our goal is to create lots of different books for different domains: technical
books, marketing management, services companies management, openerp for
accountants, ...

Books writing will be our main documentation process. At each new version of
OpenERP, we will release new versions of the different books. The editor will
organise this and will get revenues for this.

In addition to this, we use a community wiki for all others documentations that
are not directly related to the software or for documentations that are "per
module". For our main knowledge management system, we use Launchpad Answers,
where you can ask questions or reply answers.


** The Role of The Community **

This documentation writing and maintaining process tends to emphatize
individuals efforts from authors and translators. This does not means we think
the community is less important for writting documentations. The community
remains very important for different reasons:

* The community provides authors and translators because everyone can request to be an author for one or several chapters, no need to write a full book.
* The editor needs readers that will review the book before his official release.
* These readers will be choosed amongst the different contributors in the community.

To improve the quality of books versions after versions, we will extensively
work on erratas in the wiki. Community will be able to propose improvement
through the errata section.

Allowing everyone to contribute in erratas instead of directly in the content
allows us to keep into control on the quality of our documentations.
