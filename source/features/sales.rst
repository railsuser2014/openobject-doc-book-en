Sales Management
================

Sales modules allows you to manage and classify your sales orders on a
structural and hierarchical system. It gives you the ability to create new
orders and to review the existing orders in their various states. Confirmation
of an order triggers delivery of the goods, and invoicing timing is defined by
a setting in each individual order.
