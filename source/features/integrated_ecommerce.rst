Integrated E-commerce
=====================

Open ERP provides modules to synchronise automatically with all main open source
eCommerce systems: OSCommerce, eZpublish, Magento, Joomla. It allows you to
streamline and automate the sales process, from the online order to the
delivery and the invoicing.

In order to benefit from all the power of Open ERP (pricelists management, complex
taxes, warehouse integration, etc.), you can also use our own eCommerce system
that automatically plugs in an existing website. Add a few lines of HTML in your
website and Open ERP turns it as a full featured eCommerce platform.
