Dashboards
==========

Dashboards give you an overview of all the information that's important to you
on a single page. The menu gives you access to predefined boards for
Accounting, Production and Project Management.

Unlike most other ERP systems and classic statistically-based systems, Open ERP
lets dashboards be provided to all of the system's users, and not just to
directors and accountants.
