Alerts
======

Open ERP has an integrated alerts/warning system. You can configure alerts on any
step of any operation. The end-user will receive alerts on different events. We can
trigger alerts on the screen or through the internal requests system. It allows
to show the right information at the right time for each user. It also simplify
a lot the communication between the different employee of a same company.
