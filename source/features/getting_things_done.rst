Getting Things Done
===================

This module implement David Allen's methodology: "Getting Things Done". It
provides tools to help each user organise their time and tasks efficiently.
GTD rests on the principle that a person needs to move tasks out of the mind by
recording them externally. That way, the mind is freed from the job of
remembering everything that needs to be done, and can concentrate on actually
performing those tasks.
