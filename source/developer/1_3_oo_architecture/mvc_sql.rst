Example 1
---------

Suppose sale is a variable on a record of the sale.order object related to the 'sale_order' table. You can acquire such a variable doing this.::

    sale = self.browse(cr, uid, ID)

(where cr is the current row, from the database cursor, uid is the current user's ID for security checks, and ID is the sale order's ID or list of IDs if we want more than one)

Suppose you want to get: the country name of the first contact of a partner related to the ID sale order. You can do the following in Open ERP::

    country_name = sale.partner_id.address[0].country_id.name

If you want to write the same thing in traditional SQL development, it will be in python: (we suppose cr is the cursor on the database, with psycopg)

.. code-block:: python

    cr.execute('select partner_id from sale_order where id=%d', (ID,))
    partner_id = cr.fetchone()[0]
    cr.execute('select country_id from res_partner_address where partner_id=%d', (partner_id,))
    country_id = cr.fetchone()[0]
    cr.execute('select name from res_country where id=%d', (country_id,))
    del partner_id
    del country_id
    country_name = cr.fetchone()[0]

Of course you can do better if you develop smartly in SQL, using joins or subqueries. But you have to be smart and most of the time you will not be able to make such improvements:

    * Maybe some parts are in others functions
    * There may be a loop in different elements
    * You have to use intermediate variables like country_id

The first operation as an object call is much better for several reasons:

    * It uses objects facilities and works with modules inheritances, overload, ...
    * It's simpler, more explicit and uses less code
    * It's much more efficient as you will see in the following examples
    * Some fields do not directly correspond to a SQL field (e.g.: function fields in Python)

Example 2 - Prefetching
-----------------------

Suppose that later in the code, in another function, you want to access the name of the partner associated to your sale order. You can use this::

    partner_name = sale.partner_id.name

And this will not generate any SQL query as it has been prefetched by the object relational mapping engine of Open ERP.

Loops and special fields
------------------------


Suppose now that you want to compute the totals of 10 sales order by countries. You can do this in Open ERP within a Open ERP object:

.. code-block:: python

    def get_totals(self, cr, uid, ids):
       countries = {}
       for sale in self.browse(cr, uid, ids):
          country = sale.partner_invoice_id.country
          countries.setdefault(country, 0.0)
          countries[country] += sale.amount_untaxed
       return countries

And, to print them as a good way, you can add this on your object:

.. code-block:: python

    def print_totals(self, cr, uid, ids):
       result = self.get_totals(cr, uid, ids)
       for country in result.keys():
          print '[%s] %s: %.2f' (country.code, country.name, result[country])

The 2 functions will generate 4 SQL queries in total ! This is due to the SQL engine of Open ERP that does prefetching, works on lists and uses caching methods. The 3 queries are:

   1. Reading the sale.order to get ID's of the partner's address
   2. Reading the partner's address for the countries
   3. Calling the amount_untaxed function that will compute a total of the sale order lines
   4. Reading the countries info (code and name)

That's great because if you run this code on 1000 sales orders, you have the guarantee to only have 4 SQL queries.

Notes:

    * IDS is the list of the 10 ID's: [12,15,18,34, ...,99]
    * The arguments of a function are always the same:

          - cr: the cursor database (from psycopg)
          - uid: the user id (for security checks)
    * If you run this code on 5000 sales orders, you may have 8 SQL queries because as SQL queries are not allowed to take too much memory, it may have to do two separate readings.

A complete example
------------------

Here is a complete example, from the Open ERP official distribution, of the function that does bill of material explosion and computation of associated routings:

.. code-block:: python

    class mrp_bom(osv.osv):
        ...
        def _bom_find(self, cr, uid, product_id, product_uom, properties=[]):
            bom_result = False
            # Why searching on BoM without parent ?
            cr.execute('select id from mrp_bom where product_id=%d and bom_id is null
                          order by sequence', (product_id,))
            ids = map(lambda x: x[0], cr.fetchall())
            max_prop = 0
            result = False
            for bom in self.pool.get('mrp.bom').browse(cr, uid, ids):
                prop = 0
                for prop_id in bom.property_ids:
                    if prop_id.id in properties:
                        prop+=1
                if (prop>max_prop) or ((max_prop==0) and not result):
                    result = bom.id
                    max_prop = prop
            return result

                factor = factor / (bom.product_efficiency or 1.0)
                factor = rounding(factor, bom.product_rounding)
                if factor<bom.product_rounding:
                    factor = bom.product_rounding
                result = []
