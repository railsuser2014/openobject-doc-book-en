Modules - Files and Directories
-------------------------------

All the modules are located in the server/addons directory.

The following steps are necessary to create a new module:

    * create a subdirectory in the server/addons directory
    * create a module description file: **__terp__.py**
    * create the **Python** file containing the **objects**
    * create **.xml files** that download the data (views, menu entries, demo data, ...)
    * optionally create **reports**, **wizards** or **workflows**. 

!The Modules - Files And Directories - XML Files

XML files located in the module directory are used to modify the structure of the database. They are used for many purposes, among which we can cite :

    * initialization and demonstration data declaration,
    * views declaration,
    * reports declaration,
    * wizards declaration,
    * workflows declaration. 

General structure of Tiny ERP XML files is more detailed in the section `Data Loading Files XML <http://openobject.com/wiki/index.php/Developers:Developper%27s_Book/Data_Loading/DataLoadXML>`_. Look here if you are interested in learning more about *initialization* and *demonstration data declaration* XML files. The following section are only related to XML specific to *actions, menu entries, reports, wizards* and *workflows* declaration.
