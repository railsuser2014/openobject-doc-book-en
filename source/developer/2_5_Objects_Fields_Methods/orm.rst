The ORM - Object Relation Model
===============================

The Models
-----------

ORM is for Object-Relational Mapping.

OpenERP modeling is based on "objects" but is data is stored in a classical relational database named Postgresql.

ORM job is to fill the gap between Open-objects and sql tables.

Python is the programming langage giving the behavior and data description of Open-objects (This is not stored in the database). "ORM" is the python class ancestor of all Open-objects.

A Open-object is modeling by a static python description for his behavior and data, an a miror sql description for his data storage.
