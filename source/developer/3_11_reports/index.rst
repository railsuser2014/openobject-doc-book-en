There are mainly three types of reports in Open ERP:

    * OpenOffice.org reports
    * RML reports
    * custom reports (based on PostgreSQL views and displayed within the interface) 

This chapter mainly describes OpenOffice.org reports, and then XSL:RML reports. Custom reports are described in section Advanced Modeling - Reporting With PostgreSQL Views.
