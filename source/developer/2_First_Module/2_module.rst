Model-View-Controler Architecture
=================================

This chapter goes quickly into the development. Only describe what's needed to design

in objects and views.

Add some data
Use module recorder to get them for futur use


Adding complex views

* calendar : manage courses,
* graph : subscriptions, ...


Defining the process
