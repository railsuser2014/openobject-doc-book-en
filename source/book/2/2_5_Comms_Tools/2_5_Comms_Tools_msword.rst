   single: Word (Microsoft)


Microsoft Word interface
=========================

Open ERP supplies a Microsoft Word plugin that enables you to create your own document templates. What's more you can use the merge tool  *Tools > Merge documents*  to insert data from Open ERP while you generate different business documents.

So it's possible to create templates for a number of needs, such as proposals, business letters of agreement, or price requests. Each user can create his or her own document and use the plugin to obtain data from Open ERP. The plugin is very helpful for easily automating business actions.

Installing the Word plugin
---------------------------

The module for connecting Microsoft Word is also found in the list of Open ERP modules at http://openerp.com. Once it's been downloaded install the file \ ``tiny_word_plugin-X.exe``\  .

When the program is installed, you must run Microsoft Word and configure the parameters that will enable you to access the Open ERP server from Word. Click the menu  *Tools > Tiny ERP options* .

Using the Word interface
-------------------------

Start by selecting the module from which you want to make a report, for example a Sales Order. From Word you can access all the fields in an Open ERP Order, and all of the fields linked to that order such as from Order Lines, and from Products in those Order Lines.

   *Add Open ERP fields into a Word document.*


.. note::  Fields in red 

	When you've selected some fields and added them into your Word document, some of them appear in red. 
	This colour indicates that you can't use that particular field because it has a complex data 
	relationships that can only be discovered when you start to use the field.

Select the merge tool from by clicking  *Perform Mail Merge*  from the toolbar. This connects Microsoft Word to Open ERP, at which point it searches for data to insert into the document. This tool enables you to select which documents must be included in the report. Make your selection and click  *Start Merge*  to run the tool that produces your different documents.

Word then generates the documents by inserting the Open ERP data. You get one page for each selected document.

   single: Word adapter

.. note:: Testing the Word adapter 

	If you install the Word adapter as described, use the openerp_ch05X database to explore its functionality as described in this section.

In Chapter 13 you'll see another, more powerful, module that enables you to create complete reports in OpenOffice.org through an interface added directly in Open ERP. So you can create your own templates, such as fax and invoice templates.

These reports can then be exported in PDF by leaving Open ERP, or can be edited before sending to a customer. So you can also personalize the details of your faxes and invoices as needed, even though they are based on your templates.
