Mozilla Thunderbird interface
===============================

The Mozilla Thunderbird plugin enables you to carry out a series of Open ERP operations directly from the Thunderbird email client:

* create a contact or partner from an email,

* save an email and its attachments in Open ERP,

* send any file attached to an Open ERP document (such as proposals, projects, and tasks).

Installing the Thunderbird extension
-------------------------------------

To be able to use the Thunderbird plugin you first have to install the Open ERP module \ ``email_interface``\  . It's not loaded in the core of Open ERP Server 4.2.2 (so you'll have to load it using one of the methods described at the end of Chapter 1) but may be in a future version. Once you've got it into your server's filesystem it's installed the same way as all of the other modules you've handled so far.

You'll then have to install the Thunderbird extension. To do that, use the file \ ``tiny_plugin_2.0.xpi``\   which is found in the plugins directory of the \ ``email_interface``\   module. Then take the following steps:

	#. From Thunderbird, open the menu  *Tools > Complementary Modules* 

	#. Click the  *Install* button.

	#. Select the file \ ``tiny_plugin-2.0.xpi``\  

	#. Click  *Install Now* then restart Thunderbird.

Once the extension has been installed, you have only to create a shortcut in your Thunderbird toolbar for the function  *Archive to Tiny* . Do it like this:

	#. Click the right mouse button on the toolbar and select  *Personalize* 

	#. Place the icon  *Archive to Tiny* in your toolbar in the place of your choice.

.. tip::   **Attention**  *Thunderbird version* 

	The Tiny plugin for Thunderbird only works with Thunderbird version 2.0 and above.

	So check your Thunderbird version before installing, and download the latest version that you need from the following address: http://www.mozilla.org/products/thunderbird/

Thunderbird user interface
---------------------------

When you've installed the module the first thing to do is connect it to Open ERP from Thunderbird. To do this use the menu  *Tools > Tiny Plugin* .

A configuration window appears enabling you to enter configuration data about your Open ERP server.

*Configuration for accessing Open ERP from Thunderbird*


To archive an email in Open ERP from Thunderbird select the email and click on the icon  *Archive in Tiny* . Alternatively you could right-click the mouse: either opens a search dialog box.

This allows you to select an object that you'd like to add to your email and its attachments. You can select a partner, a task, a project, an analytical account, or any other object.

.. tip::   **A step further**  *Document Management* 

	The Thunderbird plugin is compatible with Open ERP's document management. So if you install the module document you could:

	* search through the content of your company's documents (those that have the type .doc, .pdf, .sxw and .odt) and also in archived emails,

	* have a shared filesystem that's connected to various Open ERP documents to share information and access it with your favorite browser,

	* organize and structure your documents (such as projects, partners and users) in Open ERP's system.

If you can't find a partner or contact to correspond with your email in Open ERP it's possible to create one on the fly simply by using the information contained in the email and clicking the  *Create*  button.

To access archived data from different documents in Open ERP you can use the  *Email Thunderbird*  interface that appears over Open ERP documents.

.. tip::   **Note**  *Testing the Thunderbird adapter* 

	If you install the Thunderbird adapter as described, use the openerp_ch05X database to explore its functionality as described in this section
