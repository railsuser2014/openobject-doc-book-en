Leads, Business Opportunities and Campaigns
*******************************************

 *This chapter extends the discussion of customer relationships into pre-sales activities such as the
 management of leads and opportunities. It introduces a more complex set of relationships between 
 partners and contacts than offered by the :mod:`base` module. 
 It shows how to use the company calendar, and discusses how a call center can use the Open ERP system.*
