Customer Relationship Management
#################################

 *It's often said that the customer is king. In the business world you'd ideally treat all your customers as royalty, at the center of attention. Open ERP's CRM module is designed to make this aim a reality, helping employees of the business understand their customers' needs better, and automating their communication efforts.*

.. tip::   **Terminology**  *CRM & SRM* 

	CRM is the abbreviation for Customer Relationship Management, and SRM is Supplier Relationship Management.

If you want to focus on your customers, you need tools to make that focus easy. Tools that will capture all the knowledge you have available, tools that will help you analyze what you know, and tools that will make it easy to use all of that knowledge and analysis.

A crucial advantage that Open ERP gives you over the more specialist CRM applications is that Open ERP knows more about your customers and your ability to supply them because it's handling all of your accounting, sales, purchases, manufacturing and fulfillment as well as linking to all of your internal staff. 

Open ERP's ``crm`` module uses that information and offers several significant features that enable you and your staff to monitor and control your supplier and customer relationships effectively, such as delegating issues to the most appropriate people, keeping a history of communications and events, qualifying prospects and detecting problems. 

It also uses several statistical tools that can analyze relationships quantitatively – your customer service performance and the quality of your suppliers, for example. Using performance analysis, you can easily put a policy of real continuous improvement in place by developing an automatic rules-based system in Open ERP.

To minimize re-typing work, Open ERP provides an email gateway that links your emails to the databases. This is a significant feature – many of your staff will then use Open ERP automatically through email without ever logging into it themselves and having to learn a new system.

Finally, at the end of this chapter you'll see an efficient method of qualifying prospects or customers that enables you to offer a service tailored to the potential value of different prospects.
