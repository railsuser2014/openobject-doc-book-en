Treatment of expenses
=====================

Employee expenses are charges incurred on behalf of the company. The company then reimburses these
expenses to the employee. The receipts encountered most frequently are:

* car travel, reimbursed per unit of distance (mile or kilometer),

* subsistence expenses, reimbursed based on the bill,

* other purchases, such as stationery and books, destined for the company but carried out by the
  employee.

An integrated process

   *Process for dealing with expense reimbursements*

Expenses generated by employees are grouped into periods of a week or a month. At the end of the
period the employee confirms all of her expenses and a summary sheet is sent to the department
manager. The manager is responsible for approving all the expense requests generated by his team.
The expenses sheet must be signed by the employee, who also attaches her receipts there.

Once the sheet has been approved by the head of department it is sent to accounts, who register the
company's liability to the employee. Accounting can then pay this invoice and reimburse the employee
who originally advanced the money.

Some receipts are for project expenses, so these can then be attached to an analytic account. The
costs incurred are then added to the supplementary cost of the analytic account when the invoice is
approved.

You often need to invoice expenses to a client, depending on the precise contract that's been
negotiated. Travelling and subsistence expenses are generally handled this way. These can be
recharged to the client at the the end of the month if the contract price has been negotiated plus
expenses.

If you have to go through many steps to reclaim expenses, it can all quickly become too cumbersome,
especially for those employees who claim large numbers of different expense lines. If you've got a
good system that integrates the management of these claims, such as the one described, you can avoid
many problems and subtly increase staff productivity.

If your systems handle expenses well then you can avoid significant losses by setting your terms of
sale effectively. In fixed-price contracts, expense reimbursements are usually invoiced according to
the actual expense. It's in your interests to systematize their treatment, and automate the process
to the maximum, to recharge as much as you are contractually able.

Claiming expenses
-----------------

.. index::
   pair: module; hr_expense

Install the module :mod:`hr_expense` to automate the management of expense claims. Users can then
enter their expenses using the menu :menuselection:`Human Resources --> Expenses --> New Expenses Sheet`
and review them using menus in :menuselection:`Human Resources --> Expenses --> My Expenses`.

Templates for the various expenses accepted by the company must previously have been created using Open ERP's
product form. You could, for example, create a product with the following parameters for the
reimbursement of travel expenses by car at 0.25 per kilometer:

*  :guilabel:`Product` : \ ``Car travel``\  ,

*  :guilabel:`Unit of measure` : \ ``km``\  ,

*  :guilabel:`Standard Cost` : \ ``0.25``\  ,

*  :guilabel:`Sale price` : \ ``0.30``\  ,

*  :guilabel:`Type of product` : \ ``Service``\  .

The employee keeps her expenses sheet in the \ ``Draft``\   state while completing it throughout the
period. At the end of the period (week or month) she can confirm her expense form using the
:guilabel:`Confirm` button on the form. This puts it into the state \ ``Waiting for validation``\  .

At the end of the period the department manager can access the list of expense forms waiting for
approval using the menu :menuselection:`Human Resources --> Expenses --> All expenses --> Expenses
waiting validation`.

.. tip:: Role Management

	You must assign the role :guilabel:`Human Resources – Expenses` to a user to enable that user to approve
	these expenses.
	You'd generally assign this role only to those people responsible for projects or departments.

	You can also assign the role :guilabel:`Human Resources – Invoicing Expenses` to users responsible for
	creating invoices.
	These roles may overlap (so the same person who approves your accounting group's expenses may also
	be responsible for creating invoices).

	To find out more about the management of roles look at :ref:`ch-config`.

The department manager can then approve the expenses, which automatically creates a supplier invoice
in the employee's name so that the employee can be reimbursed. An analytic account is coded onto
each line of the invoice. When the invoice is confirmed, general and analytic accounting entries are
automatically generated as they would be with any other invoice.

If you establish your invoicing on the basis of service time or analytic costs, the expense will
automatically be recharged to the client when the client invoice is generated for services
associated with the project.

Invoicing from timesheets lets you prepare your invoices all within the one integrated system - all
the expenses and timesheets for a project's client.
