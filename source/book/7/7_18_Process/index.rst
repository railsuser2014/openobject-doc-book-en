The organization and quality of a company is typically related to its maturity. A mature
company is one where processes are well established, and where staff don't
waste much time searching for documents or trying to find out how to do their
different tasks.

From this need for effective organization and explicit quality improvement,
have appeared numerous tools:

* The ISO9001 quality standard,

* Business Process Management (BPM) tools,

* Use Case workflows, and formalized standards such as UML,

* The company Quality Manual.

The problem is that these tools are usually quite separate from your management
system and often reserved for the use of just a few specific people in your
company. They're treated separately rather than put at the heart of your
management system. When you ask company staff about ISO9001 they usually see it
as a constraint rather than a helpful daily management tool.

To help the company meet its quality requirements and to form these processes
into assistance integrated with everyday work, Open ERP supplies a 'Corporate
Intelligence ( r )' tool that enables you to put company processes at the heart
of your management system.

The system enables:

* new employees to learn how to use the software by graphically and dynamically discovering how each
  document and action works,

* easy access to the all the links to a document and everything that's attached to it,

* people to see both a high-level map and the detail of all a company's processes,

* access to a graphical model and integrated quality manual for rapid access that depends on the
  work context,

* use of a knowledge base and capitalization of that knowledge for all of the company's actions in
  the form of interactive processes,

* an employee to become more aware of his role in the whole environment.
