Searching for documents
------------------------

You've seen several methods of accessing documents quickly:

* From attachments to an Open ERP resource,

* Through FTP access to Open ERP,

* Using the menu :menuselection:`Document Management --> Structure of Directories`.

But if you don't know where a specific document can be found, Open ERP also has a search tool
integrated into its document management. To search for a file use the menu :menuselection:`Document
Management --> Search for a file`. You get to a document search screen that lets you search amongst
all the attachments and all the documents in the FTP server.

You can search for a file using various different criteria:

* The filename,

* The owner of a file,

* The title of the resource that the file is attached to,

* The partner that the document is about,

* The directory that it's found in,

* Its creation and modification dates.

Notice here an important advantage for an integrated document management system. Information such as
which partner is associated with a document is automatically detected by Open ERP when the document
has been stored in a directory. This information is never input by the user – it's detected
automatically using the information about the resource when it's being saved as a file.

But your search isn't limited to these few fields. You can also search on the content in the files.
Each file is automatically indexed by the system to give you a search engine rather like Google's on
the whole set of company documents.

.. note:: Supported file formats

    The Open ERP document management system can index the following file formats:

    * **TXT** : text files,

    * **PDF** : PDF files,

    * **SXW** : Open Office V1 files,

    * **ODT** : Open Office V2 files,

    * **DOC** : Microsoft Word files.

    The other file formats are properly handled in the document management system but their content
    is not indexed automatically.

This functionality is very significant. All you need to do is search for a partner name or an order
number to automatically get all the documents that are referenced there. And you can use a fragment
of text to find the document you need from within that subset.

Integration with your emails
=============================

Using Outlook and Thunderbird

Working with users' changes
============================

To make the document management system's use as unobtrusive as possible the system's users should
easily be able to store all the documents that they produce or receive from their customers and
suppliers. So Open ERP supplies dashboards to help system users approve their acceptance of such
documents.

So you'll find two dashboards in the menu :menuselection:`Dashboards --> Document Management` : one
dashboard for the document management system manager and one dashboard for follwing use by different
users.

The first lets you track the change of documents by month, by customer and by type of resource. You
could also quickly assess the use that's made of the system by the various users.

The second dashboard lets you track the user that's made of the system by different employees.
You'll find the number of files sent by user and a classification of the users using document
management system the least. That will enable you to know who has been well-trained and if it is
necessary to do something about changing work methods.

Version Management
===================

There's usually a need to keep track of all the important documents that you have printed. For
example, when you send an invoice to a customer it's a good idea to store a copy of that invoice
internally in paper or electronic form. Then you can reprint it exactly in the same format as when
you sent it, even if the company's details have changed in the meantime.

To do this, Open ERP can automatically store as attachments the different reports printed by users.
By default, only invoices are saved as attachments, and they're saved when they are printed.

But you can configure the system so that it doesn't matter which type of report is printed. To
activate that functionality on another type of report, modify this in the menu
:menuselection:`Administration --> Configuration --> Low Level --> Actions --> XML Reports`.

   *Modifying the definition of a report*

Select the report that you want to change and complete the field 'Prefix for saving as an
attachment'. Once you've done that each document print action will automatically be saved as an
attachment to the document.

Documents used for company processes
=====================================

Finally, the document management system is also completely linked to the main system that manages
company processes. Then on each node of your management process you could store a procedure. Once
the user sees a process view of the relevant document he would be able to click on the directory to
get all the documents that might be useful for this phase of the process.

So you could also efficiently store the documents required for each phase of a process.
