The Open ERP solution
----------------------

Open ERP's management of documents is unique and totally innovative in its integrated approach. Its complete integration with the company's management system solves most of the problems that are encountered when you use independent document management systems:

* Login and the management of access rights is integrated with that of Open ERP for controlling access to different document types,

* Ultra-rapid access to documents, which are directly accessible through your email client or through the company management software,

* Automatic assignment of meta-information comes directly from information contained in your Open EPR login registration,

* Document workflow which automatically follow Open ERP's documentation process provide complete synchronization between the systems,

* Document classification is determined by Open ERP itself so that the structure that is created is always synchronized between the systems,

* Automatic indexation and classification of all documents produced by Open ERP for maximum efficiency.

Getting Started

To install Open ERP's document management system you just need is to install the \ ``document``\  and \ ``board_document``\ modules through the menu *Administration > Modules Management > Modules*.
