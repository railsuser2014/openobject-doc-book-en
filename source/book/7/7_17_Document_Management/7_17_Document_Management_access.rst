Internal and external access using FTP
---------------------------------------
.. index:: Directory

The first configuration step is to create a directory structure that will be used to classify your document set. You can use the structure automatically proposed by Open ERP from the menu *Document Management > Directory Structure*.

   *Structure of directories when the ``document`` module has been installed.*

In addition to the usual access to documents through Open ERP, you will be able to connect to them directly through the filesystem using the FTP protocol. To connect to the FTP server, use the following address:

========= ===========================================
Parameter Value
========= ===========================================
Server    Your Open ERP server, for example 127.0.0.1
Port      8021
Path      The '/' character, for the root
User      Your user account in Open ERP
Password  Your Open ERP password
========= ===========================================

.. note:: FTP server 

   These comment about an FTP server may appear a bit technical, but 
   it's just a standard for getting hold of files without worrying too much about the platform standards (Windows, Mac, Linux, or other Unix-like system). 
   So FTP is just a way of getting access to files without needing to use an Open ERP client. 
   There are other ways, but FTP proved itself to the developers to be the one that performed best at lowest cost.

Once you're connected using FTP you appear to get to the root of a directory for the document management system. Once you enter the directory you find a structure that matches the structure defined in Open ERP.
