Configuring workflows
=====================

Workflows represent the company's different business processes. They're completely configurable and
define the path that any Open ERP object (such as an order) must follow depending on the conditions
(for example an order over a certain value must be approved by a sales director, otherwise by any
sales person, before the delivery can be triggered).

The figure :ref:`fig-sflow` shows the standard workflow for an order. You can show it from the GTK client
starting with :menuselection:`Sales Management --> Sales Order --> All Sales Order`. Select an
order, then go to the top menu :menuselection:`Plugins --> Execute a plugin --> Print Workflow` to
show the menu below. They're designed really for administrators, so aren't available through the web
client.

Defining workflows
------------------

.. todo:: Process

Workflows can be created and modified in Open ERP's user interface.

You can look at the specifications of the workflow for the sales order above using the menu
:menuselection:`Administration --> Customization --> Workflow Definitions --> Workflows`. It's the
process named sale.order.basic. All of the nodes appearing in the graph are listed in the field
:guilabel:`Activities`, and all of the arrows are listed in the field :guilabel:`Transitions`.

You can also configure the workflows by adding new activities and transitions between activities or
by modifying the conditions that control the existing transitions.

.. note:: Defining workflows

	Workflows are defined in files named MODULE_workflow.xml which can be found in the addons directory
	on the server.
	The definition just consists of a list of activities (nodes) and transitions (arrows).

Assigning roles
---------------

Users can be linked to several roles specifying their duties in certain phases of different
workflows accompanying the various documents. For example, if a user has taken the role of services
manager he takes on the task of approving holiday requests from his staff. So his role will be
integrated in the holiday request workflow.

Role definition is done in :menuselection:`Administration --> Users --> Roles Structure -->
Roles`, the same way you define groups, except that roles can be hierarchical: a parent role has the
same influence as all of its child roles (for example, the sales director would be able to do all of
the things that have been defined for a sales person, as well as anything defined specifically for
the sales director group, if the sales director has been made a parent of the sales group).

Once the roles have been defined, you can add them into the workflow transitions using the
:guilabel:`Role` field. This means that users who have the required role can make the transitions in
the workflow, which enable them to pass from one activity to another (for example confirming an
order or an invoice).
