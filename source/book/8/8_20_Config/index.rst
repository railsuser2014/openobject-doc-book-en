**************************************
Configuring and Administering Open ERP
**************************************

 *This chapter is for the administrators of an Open ERP system.
 You'll learn to configure Open ERP to match it to your company's needs and
 those of each individual user of the system.*

Open ERP gives you great flexibility in configuring and using it, letting you modify
its appearance, the general way it functions and the different analysis tools chosen to match your
company's needs most closely. These configuration changes are carried out through the user
interface.

Users can each arrange their own welcome page and their own menu, and you can also personalize
Open ERP by assigning each user their own dashboard on their welcome page to provide them with the
most up to date information. Then they can immediately see the information most relevant to them
each time they sign in.

And Open ERP's main menu can be entirely reorganized. The management of access rights lets you
assign certain functions to specific system users. You can also assign roles, which define the part
that each system user plays in the workflows that move system documents from state to state (such as
the ability to approve employee expense requests).

.. note:: Configuration, Parameterization, Personalization, Customization

	The word *personalization* is sometimes used in this book where you might expect to find
	*configuration* or *customization*.

	*Customization* generally refers to something that requires a bit of technical effort
	(such as creating specialized code modules) and creates a non-standard system.

	*Configuration* is less radical – it's the general process of setting all
	the parameters of the software to fit the needs of your system (often called *parameterization*).
	Configuration is also, by convention, the name of the submenu below each of Open ERP's top-level menus that
	is accessible only to the administrative user for that section.

	*Personalization* is just that subset of configuration options that shapes the system to the
	operational needs of a certain person or company.

Using the *OpenOffice.org Report Designer* module you can change any part of any of the reports
produced by the system. The system administrator can configure each report to modify its layout and
style, or even the data that's provided there.

.. note::  The OpenOffice.org Report Editor

	The OpenOffice.org plug-in enables you not only to configure the reports of the basic products in
	Open ERP but also to create entirely new report templates.
	When the user uses Open ERP's client interface, OpenOffice can create a report template 
	that has access to all the data available to any Open ERP document type.

	You can easily create fax documents, quotations, or any other commercial document.
	This functionality enables you to considerably extend the productivity of your salespeople who have
	to send many proposals to customers.

Finally, you'll see how to import your data into Open ERP automatically, to migrate all of your
data in one single go.
