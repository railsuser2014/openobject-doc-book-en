Configuring and Administering Open ERP
**************************************

 *This chapter is for the administrators of an Open ERP system. 
 You'll learn to configure and personalize Open ERP to match it to your company's needs and 
 those of each individual user of the system.* 

Open ERP gives you great flexibility in the ways of configuring and using it, which let you modify its appearance, the general way it functions and the different analysis tools chosen to match your company's needs most closely. These configuration changes are carried out through the user interface.

Users can each arrange their own welcome page and their own menu, and you can also personalize Open ERP by assigning each user their own dashboard on their welcome page to provide them with the most up to date information. Then they can immediately see the information most relevant to them each time they sign in.

And Open ERP's main menu can be entirely reorganized. The management of access rights lets you assign certain functions to specific system users. You can also assign roles, which define the part that each system user plays in the workflows that move system documents from state to state (such as the ability to approve employee expense requests).

   single: Personalization

.. note:: Personalization 

	The word *personalization* is used in this book where you might expect to find customization. 
	That's because customization refers to something that requires a bit of technical effort 
	(such as creating specialized code modules) and creates a non-standard system. 

	The word configuration is more closely related – it's the general process of setting all 
	the parameters of the software to fit the needs of your system. 
	Personalization is just that subset of configuration options that shapes the system to the operational needs of a certain company.

Using the module *OpenOffice.org Report Designer* you can change any part of any of the reports produced by the system. The system administrator can configure each report to modify its layout and style, or even the data that's provided there.

.. note::  The OpenOffice.org Report Editor

	The OpenOffice.org plug-in enables you not only to configure the reports of the basic products in Open ERP but also to create new report templates. 
	When the user prints these reports through Open ERP's client interface, OpenOffice.org opens with the report containing all the selected data.

	You can also easily create fax documents, quotations, or any other commercial document. 
	This functionality enables you to considerably extend the productivity of your salespeople who have to send many proposals to customers.

Finally, you'll see how to import your data into Open ERP automatically, to migrate all of your data in one single go.
