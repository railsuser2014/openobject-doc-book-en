*********************
Production Management
*********************

 *The management of manufacturing described in this chapter will cover
 planning, ordering, inventory and the manufacturing or assembly of products from raw materials and
 components.
 It also covers consumption and production of products as well as the necessary operations on
 machinery, tools or human resources.*

The management of manufacturing in Open ERP is based on its stock management and, like it, is very
flexible in both its operations and its financial control. It particularly benefits from the use of
double-entry inventory management for manufacturing orders.

   pair: module; mrp

Manufacturing management is implemented by the :mod:`mrp` module. It is useful for transforming all
types of products:

* Assemblies of parts: composite products, soldered or welded products, assemblies, packs,

* Machined parts: machining, cutting, planing,

* Foundries: clamping, heating,

* Mixtures: mixing, chemical processes, distillation.

You'll work in two areas: on products in the first part of this chapter, and on operations in the
second part. The management of products depends on the concept of classiciations while the
management of operations depends on routing and workcenters.

.. note:: Bills of Materials

    Bills of Materials, or manufacturing specifications, are named differently depending on their
    application area, for example:

    * Restoration: Recipe,

    * Chemicals: Equation,

    * Building: Plan.
