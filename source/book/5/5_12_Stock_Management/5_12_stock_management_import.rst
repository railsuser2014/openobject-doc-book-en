Import / Export
================

Managing import / export with foreign companies can sometimes be very complex. Between a departure port and destination company, products can get stopped for several months at sea or somewhere in the numerous transportation stages and customs. If you have to manage numerous deliveries you must be able to handle this in the most efficient way you can. So it's important to:

* know where your products are,

* know when they're likely to arrive at their destination,

* know your value in transit,

* follow the development of the different steps.

Linked locations in Open ERP enable this all to be managed rather elegantly. You can use a structure like this:

Suppliers

  European Suppliers

  Chinese Suppliers

In transit

  Shanghai Port

  Pacific Ocean

  San Francisco Port

  San Francisco Customs

Stock
------

The transit location are linked between themselves with a manual confirmation step. When you receive notification that goods have been received at a port or in customs you just need to make the required internal stock move, entering data with the references you've been sent to confirm it all. Open ERP prepares all the linked moves automatically.

.. tip::  **More information** *Intrastat*

    If you do import / export you should install the module *report_intrastat*. This will enable you to prepare the reports needed to declare product exports.

You can use the lead times between different locations to account for real delays.    Your lead times and stock forecasts are calculated by Open ERP to estimate the arrival of incoming products so that you can respond to a customer's needs as precisely as possible.

You can also value the products in transit in your account depending on the chosen stock location configuration.

Rental locations
-----------------

You can manage rental locations in Open ERP very simply using the same system of linked locations. Using the module *stock_location* you can set a return date for rental items sent to customer location after a certain rental period.

Then the set of real and virtual stocks is maintained daily in real time. The different operations such as delivery and receipt after a few days are automatically suggested by Open ERP which simplifies the work of data entry.

You then have the product list found in the customer locations and your own stock in your stock location. The list of goods receipts waiting is automatically generated by Open ERP using the location links.

The same principle is used for internal stock to generate the quality control for certain products.

Consigned Products
-------------------

You can also use the principle of linked locations to manage consigned products. You can indicate that certain products should be returned to you after a certain number of days when they have been delivered to customers.

When the products have been delivered Open ERP automatically creates goods receipts for the consigned product. The indicated date is obviously approximate but enables you to forecast returns fairly efficiently.
