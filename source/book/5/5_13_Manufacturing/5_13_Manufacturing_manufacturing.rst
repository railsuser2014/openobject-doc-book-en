Manufacturing
=============

Once the Bills of Materials have been defined, Open ERP becomes capable of automatically deciding on the manufacturing route depending on the needs of the company.

Production orders can be suggested automatically by the system depending on several criteria described in the preceding chapter:

* Using the 'Make to Order' rules,

* Using the order point rules,

* Using the production plan.

*Automatically suggesting the production orders.*

Clearly it's also possible to start production manually. To do this you can use the menu *Manufacturing > Production Orders > New Production Order*.

If you haven't installed the 'Just-In-Time' planning module *mrp_jit*, you should start the calculation of requirements for Open ERP managed automatically the production order using the different system rules. To do this use the menu *Manufacturing > Calculate all requirements*.
