Scores, events and barcodes
============================

If the company wants to work with barcodes in manufacturing you can work on each operation using events. Here are some examples of events for an operations:

* Starting an operation,

* Pausing an operation,

* Restarting an operation,

* Closing an operation,

* Cancelling an operation.

You place barcodes on the production orders on the machines or operators and a form of barcodes representing the events. To print barcodes select the events using the menu *Manufacturing > Configuration > Codes from start to finish*. Then click for printing the barcodes for the selected events. You can do the same for printing barcodes for the workcenters using the menu *Manufacturing > Configuration > Workcenters*.

Using the system these operations don't need data to be entered on the keyboard. To use these barcodes, open the menu Manufacturing > Barcode events. You must then scan, in order:

#. The barcode of the production order,

#. The workcenter used,

#. The event code.

Open ERP then applies the events to the relevant operation.
