Production Management
######################

*The management of manufacturing described in this chapter will cover planning, ordering, inventory and the manufacturing or assembly of products from raw materials and components. It also covers consumption and production of products as well as the necessary operations on machinery, tools or human resources.*

The management of manufacturing in Open ERP is based on its stock management and, like it, is very flexible in both its operations and its financial control. It particularly benefits from the use of double-entry inventory management for manufacturing orders.

Manufacturing management is implemented by the *mrp* module. It is useful for transforming all types of products:

* Assemblies of parts: composite products, soldered or welded products, assemblies, packs,

* Machined parts: machining, cutting, planing,

* Foundries: clamping, heating,

* Mixtures: mixing, chemical processes, distillation.

You'll work in two areas: on products in the first part of this chapter, and on operations in the second part. The management of products depends on the concept of classiciations while the management of operations depends on routing and workcenters.

.. tip::   **Terminology**  *Bills of Materials*

    Bills of Materials, or manufacturing specifications, are named differently depending on their application area, for example:

    * Restoration: Recipe,

    * Chemicals: Equation,

    * Building: Plan.
