******************************
Logistics and Stock Management
******************************

 *Open ERP's stock management is at once very simple, flexible and complete.
 It's based on the concept of double entry that revolutionized accounting.
 The system can be described by Lavoisier's maxim “nothing lost, everything changed” or, better,
 “everything moved”.
 In Open ERP you don't talk of disappearance, consumption or loss of products:
 instead you talk only of stock moves from one place to another.*

Just as in accounting, the Open ERP system manages counterparts to each of its operations such as
receipts from suppliers, deliveries to customers, profits and losses from inventory, and consumption
of raw materials. Stock movements are always made from one location to another. To satisfy the need
for a counterpart to each stock movement, the software supports different types of stock location:

* Physical stock locations,

* Partner locations,

* Virtual counterparts such as production and inventory.

Physical locations represent warehouses and their hierarchical structure. These are generally the
locations that are managed by traditional stock management systems.

Partner locations represent your customers' and suppliers' stocks. To reconcile them with your
accounts, these stores play the role of third-party accounts. Reception from a supplier can be shown
by the movement of goods from a partner location to a physical location in your own company. As you
see, supplier locations usually show negative stocks and customer locations usually show positive
stocks.

Virtual counterparts for production are used in manufacturing operations. Manufacturing is
characterized by the consumption of raw materials and the production of finished products. Virtual
locations are used for the counterparts of these two operations.

Inventory locations are counterparts of the stock operations that represent your company's profits
and losses in terms of your stocks.

The figure :ref:`stloctree` shows the initial configuration of the stores locations when the software is
installed.

.. note::  Hierarchical stock locations

    In Open ERP locations are structured hierarchically.
    You can structure your locations as a tree, dependent on a parent-child relationship.
    This gives you more detailed levels of analysis of your stock operations and the organization of
    your warehouses.

.. tip:: Locations and Warehouses

    In Open ERP **warehouses** represent your places of physical stock.
    A warehouse can be structured into several locations at multiple levels.
    Locations are used to manage all types of storage place, such as at the customer and production
    counterparts.
