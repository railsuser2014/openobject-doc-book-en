Management of Alerts
====================

.. index:: 
   single: warning
   single: alerts
   pair: module; warning

To manage alerts on products or partners, you can install the :mod:`warning` module. Once that is
installed, you will be able to configure a series of alerts on the partners or products by
setting parameters in the new :guilabel:`Warnings` tab on each of the forms.

   *Management of alerts on products*

You can activate alerts for a series of events. For each alert you should enter a message that will
be attached to the person setting off the event. The different available events on the partner form
are:

* Entering a customer order for the partner,

* Entering a supplier order for the partner,

* Sending a delivery to the partner (or receiving an item),

* Invoicing a partner.

The alerts that can be configured on a product form are:

* The sale of that product,

* The purchase of that product.

For example, if you enter an alert for the invoicing of a customer, for an accountant entering an
invoice for that customer, the alert message will be attached as shown in the figure :ref:`fig-warnsmp`:
