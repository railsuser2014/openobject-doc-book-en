To manage supplier relations, you should install the :mod:`crm_configuration` module. You will then be
able to manage supplier complaints and integrate them with your emails and document management.

Once you've installed the :mod:`crm` module, check the checkbox by the :guilabel:`Complaints` option
during configuration. Open ERP will then create a menu in your working database for managing supplier complaints.
