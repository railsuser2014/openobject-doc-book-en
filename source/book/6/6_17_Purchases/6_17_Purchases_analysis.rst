Elementary statistics

.. index::
   pair: module; report_purchase
   pair: module; product_margin

To get statistics about your purchases you can install the modules :mod:`report_purchase` and
:mod:`product_margin`.

The first, :mod:`report_purchase`, will add two new reports in your purchase menu, analysis of
purchases by month and by product, and analysing product by month and by product category. To use
these reports use the menu :menuselection:`Purchase Management --> Reporting --> This month -->
Purchases by product`.

   *Analysis of purchases over the month by product*

This analysis is carried out on supplier orders and not on invoices or the quantities actually
received. To get an analysis by product, use the module :mod:`product_margin`. The function of this
module is described in detail in the chapter :ref:`ch-sales`.

To analyze the received quantities, you can use the statistical modules in Stock Management.
