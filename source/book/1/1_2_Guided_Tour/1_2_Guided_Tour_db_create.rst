Database creation
=================

Use the technique outlined in Chapter 1 to create a new database, \ ``openerp_ch02``\  . This database will contain the demonstration data provided with Open ERP and a large proportion of the core Open ERP functionality. You'll need to know your super administrator password for this – or you'll have to find somebody who does have it to create this seed database.

Start the database creation process from the  *Database Administration*  page by clicking  *Create*  and then completing the following fields on the  *Create Database*  form:

*  *Super administrator password* , by default it's \ ``admin``\  , if you or your system administrator haven't changed it.

*  *New database name* : \ ``openerp_ch02``\  .

*  *Load Demonstration Data*  checkbox: \ ``checked``\  .

*  *Default Language* : \ ``English``\  .
