Guided Tour
###########

Starting to discover Open ERP, using demonstration data supplied with the system to familiarize yourself with the user interface. This guided tour provides you with an introduction to many of the available system features.


You'd be forgiven a flicker of apprehension when you first sit at your computer to connect to Open ERP, since ERP systems are renowned for their complexity and for the time it takes to learn how to use them. These are, after all, Enterprise Resource Planning systems, capable of managing most elements of global enterprises, so they should be complicated, shouldn't they? But even if this is often the case for proprietary software, Open ERP is a bit of an exception in the class of  management software.

Despite its comprehensiveness, Open ERP's interface and workflow management facilities are quite simple and intuitive to use. For this reason Open ERP is one of the few software packages with reference customers in both very small businesses (typically requiring simplicity) and large accounts (typically requiring wide functional coverage).

A two-phase approach provides a good guide for your first steps with Open ERP:

#. Using a database containing demonstration data to get an overview of Open ERP's functionality (described in this chapter)
#. Setting up a clean database to configure and populate a limited system for yourself (described in the next chapter).
To read this chapter effectively, make sure that you have access to an Open ERP server. The description in this chapter assumes that you're using the Open ERP web client unless it states otherwise. The general functionality differs little from one client to the other.
