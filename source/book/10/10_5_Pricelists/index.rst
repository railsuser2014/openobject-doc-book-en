Introduction
============

The NotSoTiny have two types of customers: the final consummers and the retailers.
They have segmented their customers into two type of consummers: one shot
consummers and recurring consummers. Their policy is to 

Consummers pricelists
=====================

The price of the "one shot" consummers are given on the product form. That's
the basic price and they fix it manually. For recurring consummers, they
propose them 10% on all stockable products and 15% on services. They also
want that the stockable products finish by 0.99â‚¬.

.. note:: Exercice 1 - Define recurring consummer pricelist

    Create the recurring cnosummer

"ZeroOne Inc" is a recurring consummer. You should write this on their partner
form so that sales man always propose this discount when they do a quotation
to ZeroOne Inc.

.. note:: Exercice 2 - Set ZeroOne Inc as recurring consummer

    Create a sale order to test the prices, with services and shelves.


Retailers pricelists
====================

In the shelves market, the price of the raw material (the woods) is frequently
changing. As a result, it's very difficult for NotSoTiny to control their margin
and to have prices that adapts automatically to the market.

For retailers, as margin are lower, they compute the retailer price based on
the cost of the product.

To compute a retailer price, they take the cost of the product and apply 30%
more on it.


.. note:: Exercice 3 - Define the retailer pricelist

    Create a sale order to test the prices, with services and shelves.


Control Margins
===============

Prepare some sales orders and invoices for the demonstration purpose, using these
rules to compute customers prices. After one month working on the system, Luc, 
the sales manager, will require statistics about his margin.


.. note:: Exercice 4 - Give statistics about products margins

    Install the required modules and give statistics about the margins you made
    on the different products.
