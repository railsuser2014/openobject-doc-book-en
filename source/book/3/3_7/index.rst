*This chapter is devoted to statutory taxation and financial reporting from Open ERP. Whether you need reports about customers and suppliers, or statements for various statutory purposes, Open ERP enables you to carry out a whole range of parametric analyses of the financial health of your company.* 

Whether you want to analyze the general health of your company or review the status of an Account Receivable in detail, your company's accounts are the place to define your various business indicators.

To bring you the most accurate picture of your business, Open ERP's different accounting reports are flexible, and the results are calculated in real time. This enables you to automate recurring actions and to change your operations quickly when a company-wide problem (such cash reserves dropping too low, or receivables climbing too high) or a local problem (a client that hasn't paid, or a project budget overspend) occurs.

So this chapter describes the various reports and financial statements supplied by Open ERP's accounting module. It also describes how Open ERP handles purchase and sales taxation, and the reporting of taxation.
