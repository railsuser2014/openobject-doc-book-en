Open ERP preparation
====================

You'll need two databases for this chapter:

* \ ``openerp_ch06X``\  , which should be a restored copy of\ `` openerp_ch02``\  , the database you created through Chapter 2. It's referenced throughout the main body of this chapter because it contains demonstration data that illustrates points made in the chapter.

* \ ``openerp_ch06``\  , which should be a restored copy of \ ``openerp_ch04,``\   the database you created through Chapter 4. You can follow the instructions in this chapter to extend this database, though you'd have to generate your own data to do so.

To be able to backup and restore these databases you'll need to know your super-administrator password.

You'll also need your system's \ ``addons``\   directory to be writable, since you'll load new modules into it later in the chapter – they're not provided in the core 4.2 release of Open ERP.
