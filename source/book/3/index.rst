General Accounting
==================

*When it's well integrated with the management system, an accounting system offers a company special benefits in addition to the obvious abilities it should have to report on the financial position. This part deals with the practical aspects of accounting, and accounting's role throughout the whole company.* 

*Open ERP's accounting modules enable you not only to manage your operations clearly, following the workflow through from invoicing to payment, but also to use various tools for financial analysis based on both real-time data and recent history depending on the analysis.* 

*Your accounting structure can be completely configured, from A to Z, to match the needs of your company very closely.*
