Entries at the start of a year
==============================

To upgrade your various accounts, create a Journal of type  *Situation*  in  *Centralized
counterpart*  mode to avoid a counterpart on each line.

For each account that needs upgrading, enter account data in the journal. For this operation use the
menu :menuselection:`Financial Management --> Entries --> Journal Entries`.

You can also use OpenÂ ERP's generic import tool if you load the balance of each of your accounts
from other accounting software.
