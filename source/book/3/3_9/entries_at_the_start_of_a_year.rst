Entries at the start of a year
==============================

To upgrade your various accounts, create a Journal of type :guilabel:`Situation` in :guilabel:`Centralized
counterpart` mode to avoid a counterpart on each line.

For each account that needs upgrading, enter account data in the journal. For this operation use the
menu :menuselection:`Financial Management --> Entries Encoding --> Entries Encoding by Line`.

You can also use OpenÂ ERP's generic import tool if you load the balance of each of your accounts
from other accounting software.
