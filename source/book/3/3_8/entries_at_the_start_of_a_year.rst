Entries at the start of a year
==============================

To upgrade your various accounts, create a Journal of type  *Situation*  in  *Centralized counterpart*  mode to avoid a counterpart on each line.

For each account that needs upgrading, enter account data in the journal. For this operation use the menu  *Financial Management > Entries > Journal Entries* .

You can also use Open ERP's generic import tool if you load the balance of each of your accounts from other accounting software.
