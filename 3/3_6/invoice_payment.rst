   *Invoiceing workflow*

Invoice document can be generated form various other documents like `Sale Order`, `Purchase Order` and also
at the time of confirmation of shipment. So the systematic treatment of Invoicing Workflow is very important. Whenever
invoice is generated, first of all it has to be in `Draft` state and hence no effect of it anywhere in your
`Accounting System`. Invoice state can be changed to `Open` by accountant or in `Pro-forma` state by any other
normal user. After that invoice will be in `Paid` state. Invoice can be cancelled if it is not paid.


Customer Receipts / Supplier Vouchers
-------------------------------------

When you sell products to a customer, you can give him an invoice or a `Sale Receipt` which is also called `Customer Receipt`.
When the sales receipt is confirmed, it creates journal items automatically and you can record the customer payment related
to this sales receipt.

You can create and modify the sale receipt using the menu :menuselection:`Accounting --> Customers --> Sales Receipt`.

When you create new `Sales Receipt` you have to enter the `Customer` in it for which you want to create voucher. You can also define `Sales lines`
in the `Sales Information` tab. In which you have to define `Account` with `Analytic Account`, `Amount` and `Description`.
At the bottom of the form you can have two option for `Payment` one is `Pay Directly` and another is `Pay Later or Group Funds`.
You have to enter `Account` in the case of `Pay Directly` option. `Total` amount displays automatically with calculation of tax while
click on the `Compute Tax` button.

Keep Track of your Payments
---------------------------

You should efficiently keep track of payments of your customers and suppliers.

Sales payment allows you to register the payments you receive from your customers.
In order to record a payment, you must enter the customer, the payment method (=the journal)
and the payment amount. OpenERP will propose to you automatically the reconciliation of this
payment with the open invoices or sales receipts.

You can do this in OpenERP using the menu :menuselection:`Accounting --> Customers --> Customer Payment`.

but you have to enter the `Write-Off account` so that accounting entries can be generated by OpenERP.

The supplier payment form allows you to track the payment you do to your suppliers.
