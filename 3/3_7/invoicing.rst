Invoices
========

In OpenERP, the concept of “invoice” includes the following documents:

* The Customer Invoice

* The Supplier Invoice

* A Customer Credit Note or Customer Refund

* A Supplier Credit Note or Supplier Refund

Only the invoice type and the representation mode differ for each of the four documents. But they are
all stored in the same object type in the system.

You get the correct form for each of the four types of invoice from the menu you use to open it. The
name of the tab enables you to tell the invoice types apart when you are working on them.

.. index::
   single: invoices; types

.. note::  Types of Invoice

        There are many advantages in deriving the different types of invoice from the same object. Two of the
        most important are:

        * In a multi-company environment with inter-company invoicing, a customer invoice in one company
          becomes a supplier invoice for the other,

        * This enables you to work and search for all invoices from the same menu. If you are looking for an
          invoicing history, OpenERP provides both supplier and customer invoices in the same list, as well
          as credit notes.

.. index::
   single: credit note

.. note:: Credit Note

   A credit note is a document that enables you to cancel an invoice or part of an invoice.

To access customer invoices in OpenERP, use the menu :menuselection:`Accounting -->
Customers --> Customer Invoices`, and for supplier invoices, use the menu :menuselection:`Accounting -->
Suppliers --> Supplier Invoices`.

Most of the time, invoices are generated automatically by OpenERP as they are generated from other
processes in the system. So it is not usually necessary to create them manually, but simply approve
or validate them. OpenERP uses the following different ways of generating invoices:

* from Supplier or Customer Orders,

* from receipt or dispatch of goods,

* from work carried out (timesheets, see :ref:`ch-hr`),

* from closed tasks (see :ref:`ch-projects`),

* from fee charges or other rechargeable expenses (see :ref:`ch-services`).

The different processes generate \ ``Draft``\   invoices. These must then be approved by a suitable
system user and sent to the customer. The different invoicing methods are detailed in the following
sections and chapters.

It is also possible to enter invoices manually. This is usually done for invoices that are not
associated with an order (usually purchase orders) or Credit Notes. Also, if the system has not been
configured correctly you might need to edit the invoice before sending it to the customer.

For example, if you have not realized that the customer is tax-exempt, the invoice you generate from an
order will contain tax at the normal rates. It is then possible to edit this out of the invoice
before validating it.

Entering a Customer Invoice
---------------------------

The principle of entering data for invoices in OpenERP is very simple, as it enables non-
accountant users to create their own invoices. This means that your accounting information can be
kept up-to-date all the time as orders are placed and received, and their taxes are calculated.

At the same time, it allows people who have more accounting knowledge to keep full control over the
accounting entries that are being generated. Each value proposed by OpenERP can be modified later
if needed.

Start by manually entering a customer invoice. Use :menuselection:`Accounting -->
Customers --> Customer Invoices` and click on `New` button for this.

A new invoice form opens for entering information.

.. figure::  images/account_customer_invoice.png

   *Entering a New Invoice*

The document is composed of three parts:

* the top of the invoice, with customer information,

* the main body of the invoice, with detailed invoice lines,

* the bottom of the page, with some additional information, taxes, and the totals.

To enter a document in OpenERP, you should always fill in fields in the order they appear on
screen. Doing it this way means that some of the later fields are filled in automatically from the
selections made in earlier fields. So select the `Customer`, and the following fields are
completed automatically:

* the invoice address corresponds to the customer contact that was given the address type of
  `Invoice` in the partner form (or otherwise the address type of `Default`),

* the partner account corresponds to the account given in the `Accounting` which is found in a
  tab of the partner form,

* a specific or a default payment condition can be defined for this partner in the
  `Accounting` tab of the partner form. Payment conditions are generated by rules for the payment of
  the invoice. For example: 50% in 21 days and 50% in 60 days from the end of the month.

.. index::
   pair: properties; field

.. note:: Properties Fields

        The Properties fields on the Partner form or the Product form are multi-company fields. The value
        that the user sees in these fields depends on the company that the user works for.

        If you work in a multi-company environment that is using one database, you have several charts of
        accounts. Asset and liability accounts for a partner depend on the company that the user works for.

.. index::
   single: navigating relationships
   single: right-click

.. tip:: Seeing Partner Relationships

   You can reach more information from certain relation fields in OpenERP.

   * In the web client, a relation is commonly a hyperlink
     - it takes you to the main form for that entity, with all of the actions and links.

   So one way or another you can rapidly reach the partner's:

   * current sales and purchases,

   * CRM requests,

   * open invoices,

   * accounts records,

   * payable and receivable accounts.

You can add more detailed additional information to the invoice and select the currency that you want to invoice in.

Once the invoice heading is saved, you must enter the different invoice lines. You could use either
of the two techniques:

* enter the whole field manually,

* use a product to complete the different fields automatically.

.. tip:: Invoice Line Description

        The invoice line description is more of a title than a comment. If you want to add more detailed
        comments you can use the field `Additional Information`.

So select the product \ ``LCD Monitor`` \ in the product field in an invoice line. The
following fields are then completed automatically:

*  `Description` : this comes from the product, in the language of the partner,

*  `Account` : determined by the purchase or sales account defined in the
   product properties. If no account is specified in the product form, OpenERP uses the properties of
   the category that the product is associated with.

*  `Unit of Measure` : this is defined by default in the product form,

*  `Unit Price` : this is given by the sales price in the product form.

*  `Taxes` : provided by the product form and the partner form.

.. index::
   single: module; account_tax_include

.. tip::  Managing the Price with Tax Included

        By default, OpenERP invoices and processes the price without taxes – they are managed as a
        separate amount.
        OpenERP can manage tax inclusive prices when you check the `Tax Included in Price` field true when configuring
        the tax.

You can enter several invoice lines and modify the values that are automatically completed
by OpenERP.

Once the invoice lines have been entered, you can click `(update)` on the invoice to get
the details of tax calculated such as:

* Untaxed amount,

* Tax amount,

* Total amount.

In the `Other Info` tab at the bottom you will find the details of the total
calculated for different tax rates used in the invoice.

Before approving the invoice you can modify the date and the accounting period, which are entered by
default as today's date.

A click on `PRO-FORMA` moves from the \ ``Draft`` \ to \ ``Pro-forma`` \ state. And click `Validate` when you want to approve the invoice. It moves from the \ ``Draft`` \
state to the \ ``Open``\  state.

.. note:: PRO-FORMA button

        In order to get the `PRO-FORMA` button on invoice, go to the menu :menuselection:`Settings --> Accounting`, *eInvoicing & Payments* section and click the boolean field *Allow pro-forma invoices.*

When you have validated an invoice, OpenERP gives it a unique number from a defined sequence. By
default it takes the form \ ``Journal Code/Year/Sequence Number`` \ for example, \ ``SAJ/2010/005`` \. You cannot modify an
invoice number, but instead, you should modify the sequence numbers through the menu :menuselection:`Settings --> Configuration --> Accounting`, *eInvoicing & Payments* section and provide *Next Invoice number*

Accounting entries corresponding to this invoice are automatically generated when you approve the
invoice. You see the details by clicking the entry in the `Journal Entry` field and searching
there for the account moves generated by that invoice number.

Furthermore, you can also `Print` or `Email` your Invoice.

Tax Management
--------------

Details on the product form determine the selection of applicable taxes for an
invoice line. By default, OpenERP takes account of all the taxes defined in the product form.

Take the case of the following product

* Applicable taxes:

        - TVA: 19.6% type TVA

        - DEEE: 5.5, type DEEE


.. index::
   single: DEEE tax

.. note:: DEEE Tax

        The DEEE tax (disposal of electronic and electrical equipment) is an ecological tax that was
        imposed in France from 2009. It is applied to batteries to finance their recycling and is a fixed
        sum that is applied to the before-tax amount on the invoice.

If you trade with a company in your own country, and your country has a DEEE-type tax, the
applicable taxes for this invoice could be:

* DEEE: 5.5,

* TVA: 19.6%.

If you sell to a customer in another company in the community (intracommunity), instead, then tax is
not charged. In the partner form, in the tab `Accounting`, the field `Fiscal Position`
maintains information whether the customer is within the region or not. When you create an invoice for this customer, OpenERP will calculate the following taxes on the product:

* DEEE: 5.5,

* TVA intracommunity: 0%.

If you have not entered the parameters in the customer form correctly, OpenERP will suggest incorrect
taxes in the invoice. That is not a real issue, because you can always modify the
information directly in the invoice before approving it.

.. tip:: Occasional Invoices

        When you create an invoice for a product that will only be bought or sold once, you do not have to
        encode a new product.
        Instead, you will have to provide quite a bit of information manually on the invoice line:

		* product description,
		* account,
		* quantity,
		* unit price.

Cancelling an Invoice
---------------------

By default, OpenERP will not allow you to cancel an invoice once it has been approved. Since
accounting entries have been created, you theoretically cannot go back and delete them. However, in
some cases, it is more convenient to cancel an invoice when there is an error than to produce a credit
note and reconcile the two entries. Your attitude to this will be influenced by current legislation
in your accounting jurisdiction and your adherence to accounting purity.

OpenERP accommodates either approach. Install the account_cancel module. Then allow cancelling an invoice by checking the box
`Allow Cancelling Entries` in the Journal corresponding to this invoice. You will then be allowed to
cancel the invoice if the following two conditions are met:

        #. The accounting entries have not been reconciled or paid: if they have, then you will have to cancel
           the reconciliation first.

        #. The accounting period or the fiscal year has not already been closed: if it is closed then no
           modification is possible.

Cancelling an invoice has the effect of automatically modifying the corresponding accounting
entries.

To be able to cancel invoices, you should install the module :mod:`account_cancel`. You can cancel an invoice if the :guilabel:`Allow Cancelling Entries` function has been activated in the journal and the entries have not yet been reconciled. You could then move it from \ ``Cancelled`` \
to the \ ``Draft`` \ state to modify it and regenerate it.

.. tip::  Numbering Invoices

        Some countries require you to have contiguously numbered invoices (that is, with no break in the sequence).
        If, after cancelling an invoice that you are not regenerating,
        you find yourself with a break in the numbering you would have to go and modify the sequence,
        redo the invoice and replace the sequence number with its original value.

        You can control the sequences using the menu :menuselection:`Settings --> Technical -->
        Sequences & Identifiers --> Sequences`.

Cancelling an invoice will cause a break in the number sequence of your invoices. You are
strongly advised to recreate this invoice and re-approve it to fill the hole in the numbering if you can.

.. tip:: Duplicating a Document

        The duplication function can be applied to all the system documents: you can duplicate anything –
        a product, an order, or a delivery.

.. note:: Duplicating Invoices

        Instead of entering a new invoice each time, you can base an invoice on a similar preceding one
        and duplicate it. To do this, first search for a suitable existing invoice. In the web client, show
        the invoice in read-only (non-editable) form view, then click on `More` and `Duplicate`. In the GTK client,
        select :menuselection:`Form --> Duplicate` from the top menu.

        The duplication creates a new invoice in the ``Draft`` state. That enables you to modify it before
        approving it. Duplicating documents in OpenERP is an intelligent function, which enables the
        duplicated invoice to be given its own sequence number, today's date, and the draft state, even if
        the preceding invoice has been paid.

Creating a Supplier Invoice
---------------------------

The form that manages supplier invoices is very similar to the one for customer invoices. However,
it has been adapted to simplify rapid data entry and monitoring of the amounts recorded.

.. tip::  Entering Data

        Many companies do not enter data on supplier invoices, but simply enter accounting data corresponding to
        the purchase journal.

        This particularly applies to users that have focused on the accounting system rather than all the
        capabilities provided by an ERP system.
        The two approaches reach the same accounting result: some prefer one and others prefer the other
        depending on their skills.

        However, when you use the Purchase Management functions in OpenERP you should work directly on
        invoices because they are provided from Purchase Orders or Goods Receipt documents.

To enter a new supplier invoice, use the menu :menuselection:`Accounting --> Suppliers --> Supplier Invoices`.

Everything is similar to the customer invoice, starting with the `Journal`
unless the default is acceptable, and then the `Supplier`, which will automatically complete the following fields

* Partner `Account`.

Unlike the customer invoice, you do not have to enter payment conditions – simply a `Due
Date` if you want one.
If you do not give a due date, OpenERP assumes that this invoice will be paid in cash.
If you want to enter more complete payment conditions than just the due date, you can use the `Payment
Term` field which you can find on the second tab `Other Info`.

Indicate the `Currency` if the invoice is not going to use the default currency, then you can enter
the `Invoice lines`.

Just like the customer invoice, you have the choice of entering all the information manually or use
a product to complete many of the fields automatically. When you enter a product, all of the following
values are completed automatically:

* the product `Account` is completed from the properties of the product form or the
  `Category` of the product if nothing is defined on the product itself,

* the `Taxes` come from the product form and/or the partner form, based on the same
  principles as the customer invoice,

* the `Quantity` is set at 1 by default but can be changed manually,

* `Unit Price` : this is given by the cost price in the product form.

You can click `(update)` on the invoice in the `Edit` mode to get the details of tax calculated.

OpenERP automatically completes the `Invoice Date` and the accounting period.

.. index::
   single: declarations

.. note::  Dates and Accounting Periods

        Accounting periods are treated as legal period declarations. For example, a tax declaration for an
        invoice depends on the accounting period and not on the date of invoicing.

        Depending on whether your declarations are made monthly or quarterly, the fiscal year contains
        either twelve or four accounting periods.

        The dates are shown in the document you created in the accounting system. They are used for
        calculating due dates.

.. index::
   pair: accounts; due date

The two pieces of information do not have to have the same date. If, for example, you receive an
invoice dated 5th January which relates to goods or services supplied before 31st December, the
invoice may be coded into the December accounting period and thus be recognized in that period for
the tax declaration, while the invoice can remain 5th January which remains the basis of the due
date for payment.

You can find that the amounts do not correspond with what your supplier has given you on paper for
reasons that can include:

* the supplier made a calculation error,

* the amounts have been rounded differently.

.. tip:: Rounding Tax

        It often happens that a supplier adds 1 to the total because the tax calculation has been rounded
        upwards. Some tax amounts are not valid because of this rounding.

        For example, it is impossible to arrive at the amount of 145.50 if you are working to a precision of 2
        decimal places and a rate of 19.6%:

        * 121.65 x 1.196 = 145.49

        * 121.66 x 1.196 = 145.51

In this case you can add a row in the Taxes so that you can adjust a total.

When the totals tally, you can validate the invoice. OpenERP then generates the corresponding
accounting entries. You can manage those entries using the `Account` fields on the
invoice and on each of the invoice lines.

.. index::
   single: Credit Notes

Credit Notes / Refunds
----------------------

Entering a customer credit note is almost identical to entering a customer invoice. You just start
from the menu :menuselection:`Accounting --> Customers --> Customer Refunds`.

Similarly, entering a supplier credit note is the same as that of the supplier invoice, and so you
use the menu :menuselection:`Accounting --> Suppliers --> Supplier Refunds`.

It is easy to generate a credit note quickly from an existing invoice. To do this, select a customer
or supplier invoice which is in ``Paid`` state and click the `Refund` button. OpenERP
opens a new payment invoice form for you in the \ ``Draft``\   state so that you can modify it before
approval.

.. index::
   pair: multiple; selection
   pair: multiple; action

Below you find the different options displayed when you click the Refund button on an invoice.

Create a Draft Refund
    Creates a draft credit note of the complete invoice. You can change this credit note, i.e. to make a partial credit note.
Modify
    Creates a credit note for the existing invoice, validates the credit note and reconciles it with the invoice. The existing invoice is duplicated so that you can modify it.
Cancel
    Creates a credit note for the complete invoice, validates the credit note and reconciles it with the invoice concerned. 

Payments
--------

An invoice is automatically marked as ``Paid`` by OpenERP once invoice entries have been reconciled
with payment entries. You yourself do not have to mark the invoices as paid: OpenERP manages that
when you reconcile your payments.

.. tip::  Reconciling a Credit Note

        Generally, you reconcile the invoice's accounting entries with their payment(s).
        But you can also reconcile an invoice with the entries from the corresponding credit note instead,
        to mutually cancel them.

You have seen the `Payment` button in the invoice form which is in ``Open`` state.
This lets you enter payments and get entries reconciled very quickly.

You can also manage the payment of invoices when you are entering bank statements and cash
transactions. These allow better control of financial transactions and permit greater flexibility in
areas such as:

* advance and partial payments of invoices,

* payment of several invoices by several payments,

* fine-grained management of different due dates on the same invoices,

* management of adjustments if there are different amounts to those on the invoice.
