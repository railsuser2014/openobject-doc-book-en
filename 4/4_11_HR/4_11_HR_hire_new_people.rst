Initially, the applicant state is ``New``, after that it can be converted to ``In Progress``.
If the applicant is at one of the different stages like it may be in `Waiting for approval by human resource department` or `Waiting for offer acceptance by applicant`,
in these cases, the applicant state should be ``Pending``. When the status is ``Hired``, you can find that applicant's detail from the list of employees.

.. index::
   single: recruitments; create applicants from e-mail

Create applicants automatically based on incoming mail and keep track of attachments such as resumes and cover letters
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You have seen how to create new applicants from the `Applicants` form. You can also configure your email server in OpenERP to create new applicants based on incoming mails. For example, if you have an e-mail ID ``jobs@yourcompany.com``, you can configure it such that all emails received at this ID automatically generate new job applicants.

For this, you have to install the :mod:`fetchmail` module from module list and For configuring :guilabel:`Fetch Emails` Go to menu :menuselection:`Settings --> Configuration --> Human Resources` tick ``Create applicants from an incoming email account`` and click on configure button or Navigate to :menuselection:`Setting --> Technical --> Email --> Incoming Mail Servers` and click :guilabel:`Create`. Supply the following information in the `Email Servers` form:

* :guilabel:`Name` : A name for the server configuration.
* :guilabel:`Server Type` : Either ``POP Server`` or ``IMAP Server``.
* :guilabel:`Keep Attachment` : Set to ``True``, to be able to retrieve attachments like CVs, cover letters, etc.
* :guilabel:`Server` : Server name.
* :guilabel:`Port` : Server port.
* :guilabel:`User Name` : The username on this e-mail server.
* :guilabel:`Password` : The password for access to this e-mail account.
* :guilabel:`Model` : The object model for which you wish to generate a record. Select ``Applicant`` (hr.applicant) in this case.

   *Configuring an e-mail server*

After configuring your server, click the :guilabel:`Test & Confirm` button to enable this configuration and click on  Fetch `Now button` to start receiving e-mails.

Whenever you receive a new e-mail at the configured e-mail address, a new applicant record is created having the same subject name as the e-mail subject. The applicants e-mail details are stored too, for future correspondence. You can add more details to this job application. You can view these newly created applicants from :menuselection:`Human Resources --> Recruitment --> Applications`. In the figure :ref:`ejob`, the `Initial Qualification` applicants have been created automatically from received e-mails.

You can define these in the :guilabel:`Survey` tab of the form. When you have entered the necessary details in the form, click :guilabel:`Save`. Since you will use this survey in a job interview, click the :guilabel:`Open` button to change the survey's state from ``Draft`` to ``Open``.

Then, go to :menuselection:`Human Resources --> Configuration --> Job Positions` and select the job position that the applicant has applied for, or create a new job position. In the :guilabel:`Interview Form` field of the `Job Positions` form, enter the name of the survey you have just created, thus linking a questionnaire with this job profile and making it available for use during the interview.

You can now open the form of the applicant whose interview you wish to initiate. If an :guilabel:`Applied Job` is specified to which a survey is linked, the :guilabel:`Start Interview` button becomes accessible. Click it to initiate the survey, and fill in the applicant's response as you proceed.
