Holiday Management
==================

You can manage leaves taken by employees using the :mod:`hr_holidays`
module. The configuration wizard to install this module is shown below:

   *Configuration wizard to install hr_holidays module*

Using the menu :menuselection:`Human Resources --> Holidays --> Leave Requests` an employee can request a leave.

Leaves requests can be recorded by employees and validated by their managers.
Once a leave request is validated, it appears automatically in the agenda of the employee.
You can define several allocation types (paid holidays, sickness, etc.) and manage allocations
per type.

OpenERP can provide the following features for efficient holiday management process:

* It helps you to manage leaves and leave requests.
* Synchronisation with an internal agenda (use of :mod:`crm`) is possible:
  in order to automatically create a case when a holiday request is accepted,
  you have to link the holidays status to a case section.
* You can set up colour preferences according to your leave type, for example, `Sick Leave` should be red in reports.
* An employee can request for more days off, by making a new Allocation Request through :menuselection:`Human Resources --> Holidays --> Allocation Requests`.

The statistical report for leaves can be seen using the
:menuselection:`Human Resources --> Reporting --> Holidays --> Leaves Analysis` menu.

* :guilabel:`Description` : Reason for leave.
* :guilabel:`Leave Category` : Either ``By Employee`` or ``By Employee Category``.

The employee can click :guilabel:`Confirm` to make the leave request available to his manager for approval. The employee's manager can find leave requests awaiting approval by navigating to :menuselection:`Human Resources --> Holidays --> Leave Requests` and clicking :guilabel:`Clear` and :guilabel:`To Approve` filter button. The manager can select a pending request to open its form view and click :guilabel:`Refuse` to reject the request or :guilabel:`Approve` to accept the request.

   single: holidays; previous requests

Track previous Holiday requests
-------------------------------

Previous holidays can be tracked in a number of ways in OpenERP. You can get a report of leave requests by all users from :menuselection:`Human Resources --> Holidays --> Leave Requests`. Click :guilabel:`Clear` and then :guilabel:`Validated` to see a list of all approved leave requests. To see refused requests, click :guilabel:`Clear` and see the records marked with the colour red.

To see previous allocation requests, navigate to :menuselection:`Human Resources --> Holidays --> Allocation Requests` and follow the same procedure as above.

Through :menuselection:`Human Resources --> Holidays --> Leaves Summary`, you can track previous leaves as well as allocation requests in the same manner, but only for the currently logged in user. By default, you can see the requests grouped by leave type.

:menuselection:`Human Resources --> Reporting --> Holidays --> Leaves Analysis` will give you the statistical report of leaves and allocations grouped by employee and leave type. To see all requests without grouping, click :guilabel:`Clear`.

All the above statistical reports are enhanced by various filters and groupings to assist you in your search for required information. You can filter requests by their :guilabel:`State` (`Validated`, `To Confirm`, `To Approve`), :guilabel:`Employee`, :guilabel:`Department` and :guilabel:`Leave Type`. You can also view requests placed in :guilabel:`This Month`. You can group by :guilabel:`Employee`, :guilabel:`Manager`, :guilabel:`Department`, :guilabel:`Type` and :guilabel:`State`.

You may select a :guilabel:`From` date, a :guilabel:`Leave Type` (``Validated``, ``Confirmed`` or ``Both Validated and Confirmed``) and select atleast one department. Click :guilabel:`Print` to generate a PDF report based on your specifications.

   single: holidays; allocation requests

Allow employees to enter their own allocation requests
------------------------------------------------------

To be able to request leaves at all, an employee must be allocated some leaves which he can avail of. Usually the management makes an allocation of leaves for its employees. But, for instance, when an employee has been working on an exceptional basis on weekends, he might be entitled to extra leaves. In such a case, the employee himself can be allowed to place a request for allocation, which can then be approved or rejected by his manager. If approved, the employee can request leaves based on the type and limit of this allocation too.

Leave allocations can be requested from :menuselection:`Human Resources --> Holidays --> Allocation Requests`. In its form view you can fill the following details:

* :guilabel:`Description` : A name for the request.
* :guilabel:`Allocation Category` : Either ``By Employee`` or ``By Employee Category``.
* :guilabel:`Employee` : If allocation category is ``By Employee``, you must select an employee for whom this allocation is made.
* :guilabel:`Category` : If allocation category is ``By Employee Category``, you must select an employee category for whom this allocation is made.
* :guilabel:`Leave Type` : Select a pre-defined leave type.
* :guilabel:`Number of Days` : The number of days requested for allocation.
* :guilabel:`Reasons` : Specify the reason of request.

The remaining fields are read-only and will acquire details once the request has been accepted or rejected. The employee can click :guilabel:`Confirm` to send the allocation request to his manager. The state of the request will now be ``Waiting Approval``.

   *Allocation Requests form*

The manager will then find this request in his list of allocation requests. He can then either click :guilabel:`Refuse` to reject the request or click :guilabel:`Approve` to accept the request.
