Analytic Entries
================

Integrated with General Accounting
----------------------------------

Just as in general accounting, analytic entries must belong to an account and an analytic journal.

Analytic records can be distinguished from general records by the following characteristics:

* they are not necessarily legal accounting documents,

* they do not necessarily belong to an existing accounting period,

* they are managed according to their date and not an accounting period,

* they do not generate both a debit and a credit entry, but a positive amount (income) or a negative
  amount (cost).

   *Analytic account records for a customer project*

The figure :ref:`fig-accanmv` represents the entries on an analytic account for a customer project.

You can see there:

* the service costs for staff working on the project,

* the costs for reimbursing the expenses of a return journey to the customer,

* purchases of goods that have been delivered to the customer,

* sales for recharging these costs.

Manual Entries
--------------

Even though most analytic entries are produced automatically by the other Open ERP documents it is
sometimes necessary to make manual record entries. It is usually needed for certain analytic
operations that have no counterpart in the general accounts.

To make manual record entries, use the menu :menuselection:`Accounting --> Journal Entries --> Analytic Journal Items` and click on `New` button.

.. note:: Analytic entries

	To make an analytic entry, Open ERP asks you to specify a general account.
	This is given only for information in the different cross-reports.
	It will not create any new entries in the general accounts.

Select a journal and complete the different fields. Write an expense as a negative amount and income
as a positive amount.

.. index::
   pair: cost; allocation

.. tip::  Entering a date

	To enter a date in the editable list you can use the calendar widget in the web client or, in the
	GTK client, if you enter just the day of the month Open ERP automatically completes the month and
	year when you press the tab key (Tab).

	.. note:: Example Cost redistribution

		One of the uses of manual data entry for analytic operations is reallocation of costs. For
		example, if a development has been done for a given project but can be used again for another
		project you can reallocate part of the cost to the other project.

		In this case, make a positive entry on the first account and a negative entry for the same
		amount on the account of the second project.

Automated Entries
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Analytic accounting is totally integrated with the other Open ERP modules, so you never have to re-
enter the records. They are automatically generated by the following operations:

* confirmation of an invoice generates analytic entries for sales or purchases connected to the
  account shown in the invoice line,

* the entry of a service generates an analytic entry for the cost of this service to the given
  project,

* the manufacture of a product generates an entry for the manufacturing cost of each operation in
  the product range.

Other documents linked to one of these three operations produce analytic records indirectly. For
example, when you are entering a customer sales order you can link it to the customer's analytic
account. When you are managing by case or project, mark the project with that order. This order will
then generate a customer invoice, which will be linked to the analytic account. When the invoice is
validated it will automatically create general and analytic accounting records for the corresponding
project.

Expense receipts from an employee can be linked to an analytic account for reimbursement. When a
receipt is approved by the company, a purchase invoice is created. This invoice represents a debit
on the company in favour of the employee. Each line of the purchase invoice is then linked to an
analytic account which automatically allocates the costs for that receipt to the corresponding
project.

To visualize the general entries following these different actions you can use one of the following
menus:

	#. To see all of the entries, :menuselection:`Accounting --> Journal Entries --> Analytic Journal Items`

	#. To see the entries per account, per user, per product or per partner, you can use menu :menuselection:`Accounting --> Reporting --> Statistic Reports --> Analytic Entries Analysis`.

Analytic Models
---------------

Using `Analytic Model` concept you can distribute your income or expense to your analytic accounts.
You can define your analytic plans using menu :menuselection:`Accounting --> Configuration --> Analytic Accounting --> Multi Plans --> Analytic Plan.`

   *Definition of Analytic Plan*

Using the link `Distribution Models` given on right side of `Analytic Plan` form, you can define
the distribution of either your expenses while creating supplier invoice or revenue when defining customer invoices.

   *Definition of Distribution Models*

As for example, when you create the invoice (suppose 1000 EUR) for the product 'Client Project' with analytic distribution that
we defied as above.

When invoice has been validated then you can find the Analytic Journal Entries with distributed amount among the analytic account using the menu
:menuselection:`Accounting --> Journal Entries --> Analytic Journal Items.`

   *Journal Entries with distributed amount*

You can also specify default 'Analytic Distribution' for particular product, partner, user and company for specific time interval using
the menu :menuselection:`Accounting --> Configuration --> Analytic Accounting --> Analytic Defaults.`
