Import / Export
===============

Managing import / export with foreign companies can sometimes be very complex. Between a departure
port and the destination company, products can get stopped for several weeks at sea or somewhere in the
numerous transportation stages and customs. To manage such deliveries efficiently it is important to:

* know where your products are,

* know when they are likely to arrive at their destination,

* know your value in transit,

* follow the development of the different steps.

Linked locations in OpenERP enable you to manage all this rather elegantly. You can use a structure
like this:

* Suppliers

  * European Suppliers

  * Chinese Suppliers

* In transit

  * Shanghai Port

  * Pacific Ocean

  * San Francisco Port

  * San Francisco Customs

Stock
-----

The transit locations are linked between themselves with a manual confirmation step. The internal
stock move is validated at each port and customs arrival. OpenERP prepares all the linked moves
automatically.

.. index::
   single: module; report_intrastat

.. note:: Intrastat

    Companies that do import / export should install the module :mod:`report_intrastat`.
    This enables them to prepare the reports needed to declare product exports.

You can use the lead times between different locations to account for real delays.
Your lead times and stock forecasts are calculated by OpenERP to estimate the arrival of
incoming products so that you can respond to a customer's needs as precisely as possible.

You can also value the products in transit in your account depending on the chosen stock location
configuration.

.. index:: rent

Rental locations
----------------

.. index::
   single: module; stock_location

You can manage rental locations in OpenERP very simply using the same system of linked locations.
Using the module :mod:`stock_location` you can set a return date for rental items sent to customer
location after a certain rental period.

Then the set of real and virtual stocks is maintained daily in real time. The different operations
such as delivery and receipt after a few days are automatically suggested by OpenERP which
simplifies the work of data entry.

You then have the product list found in the customer locations and your own stock in your stock
location. The list of goods receipts waiting is automatically generated by Open ERP using the
location links.

Suppose you want to give a product (:guilabel:`PC3`) on rent to your customer (:guilabel:`Axelor`) for 30 days.
Two stock movement entries are needed to manage this scenario.

#. Product goes out from :guilabel:`Stock` (your company's location) to :guilabel:`Axelor - Rental Location` (your customer location).
#. Product will be returned into :guilabel:`Stock` (your company's location) from :guilabel:`Axelor - Rental Location` (your customer location) after 30 days.

To manage rental products by linking locations, configure a rental location (:guilabel:`Axelor - Rental Location`) as
shown in the following figure using the menu :menuselection:`Warehouse --> Configuration -->
Warehouse Management --> Locations`.

   *Configuration of a rental location `Axelor - Rental Location`*

Using the menu :menuselection:`Warehouse --> Traceability --> Stock Moves` you can create a
stock movement entry from `Stock` to `Customer Location` (:guilabel:`Axelor - Rental Location`) in OpenERP
for a rental product (:guilabel:`PC3`).

.. figure:: images/stock_move_rental_location.png
   :scale: 75
   :align: center

   *Stock movement entry to send the product `PC3` to the customer location*

The stock movement entry from `Customer Location` (:guilabel:`Axelor - Rental Location`) to `Stock` generates
automatically with the proper `Scheduled Date` by OpenERP when you confirmed previous stock movement entry by
clicking on :guilabel:`Process Now` button.

The same principle is used for internal stock to generate the quality control for certain products.

Consigned Products
------------------

The principle of linked locations is used to manage consigned products. You can specify that
certain products should be returned to you a certain number of days after they have been
delivered to customers.

When the products have been delivered, OpenERP automatically creates goods receipts for the
consigned product. The specified date is obviously approximate but enables you to forecast returns.
