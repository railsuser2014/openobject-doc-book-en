Understanding Double-Entry Stock Management
===========================================

To illustrate this concept of stock management, see how stock moves are generated by the following
operations:

* Receiving products from a supplier,

* Delivery to a customer,

* Inventory operation for lost materials,

* Manufacturing.

.. index::
   single: module; stock

The structure of stock locations is shown by the figure :ref:`fig-stloctree`. Stocks are assumed to be totally
empty and no operation is in progress nor planned.

If you order '30 bicycles' from a supplier, Open ERP will then do the following operations after the
receipt of the products:

.. table:: Stock Move operation from Suppliers to Stock

   ================================================== =============
   Location                                           Products
   ================================================== =============
   Partner Locations > Suppliers                      -30 bicycles
   Physical Locations > OpenERP S.A. > Stock          +30 bicycles
   ================================================== =============

If you deliver 2 bicycles to a European customer you will get the following transactions for the
delivery:

.. table:: Stock Move operation from Stock to European Customers

   ================================================== =============
   Location                                           Products
   ================================================== =============
   Physical Locations > OpenERP S.A. > Stock          -2 bicycles
   Partner Locations > Customers > European Customers +2 bicycles
   ================================================== =============

When the two operations are complete you will then get the following stock in each location:

.. table:: Resulting stock situation

   ================================================== =============
   Location                                           Products
   ================================================== =============
   Partner Locations > Suppliers                      -30 bicycles
   Physical Locations > OpenERP S.A. > Stock          +28 bicycles
   Partner Locations > Customers > European Customers +2 bicycles
   ================================================== =============

So you can see that the sum of the stocks of a product in all the locations in Open ERP is always
zero. In accounting you would say that the sum of the debits is equal to the sum of the credits.

Partner locations (customers and suppliers) are not located under your company in the hierarchical
structure, so their contents are not considered as part of your own stock. So if you look just at
the physical locations inside your own company those two bicycles are no longer in your company.
They are not in your own physical stock but it is still very useful to see them in your customer's
stock because that helps when you carry out detailed stock management analysis.

.. note:: Accounts

     In managing stock, a gap between the data in the software and real quantities in stock is
     difficult to avoid.
     Double-entry stock management gives twice as many opportunities to find an error.
     If you forget two items of stock this error will automatically be reflected in the
     counterpart's location.

You can make a comparison with accounting, where you will easily find an error because you can look
for an anomaly in an account or in the counterparts: if there is not enough in a bank account then that is
probably because someone's forgotten to enter a customer's invoice payment. You always know that the
sum of debits must equal the sum of the credits in both accounting and Open ERP's stock management.

In accounting, all documents lead to accounting entries that form the basis of management
accounting. If you create invoices or code in statements of account, for example, the results of the
operations are accounting entries on accounts. And it is the same for stock management in Open ERP.
All stock operations are carried out as simple stock moves. Whether you pack items, or manufacture
them, or carry out a stock inventory operation, stock moves are carried out every time.

You have seen a fairly simple example of goods receipt and product delivery, but some operations are
less obvious – a stock inventory operation, for example. An inventory operation is carried out
when you compare the stock shown in software with real stock numbers counted in the stores.

.. index::
   single: stock; inventory operation
   single: stock; stock check

In Open ERP, with its double-entry stock management, you would use stock moves for this inventory
operation. That helps you manage your stock traceability. If there are 26 bicycles in real stock but
Open ERP shows 28 in the system. You then have to reduce the number in Open ERP to 26. This
reduction of 2 units is considered as a loss or destruction of products and the correction is
carried out as in the following operation:

.. table:: Inventory operation to adjust stock

   ================================================== =============
   Location                                           Products
   ================================================== =============
   Physical Locations > OpenERP S.A. > Stock          -2 bicycles
   Virtual Locations > Inventory Loss                 +2 bicycles
   ================================================== =============

The product stock under consideration then becomes:

.. table:: Real and counterpart stocks when operations are completed

   ================================================== =============
   Location                                           Products
   ================================================== =============
   Partner Locations > Suppliers                      -30 bicycles
   Physical Locations > OpenERP S.A. > Stock          +26 bicycles
   Partner Locations > Customers > European Customers +2 bicycles
   Virtual Locations > Inventory Loss                 +2 bicycles
   ================================================== =============

This example shows one of the great advantages of this approach in terms of performance analysis.
After a few months, you can just make a stock valuation of the location ``Virtual Locations >
Inventory Loss`` to give you the value of the company's stock losses in the given period.

Now see how the following manufacturing operation is structured in Open ERP. To make a bicycle you
need two wheels and a frame. This means that there should be a reduction of two wheels and a frame
from real stock and the addition of a bicycle there. The consumption / production is formalized by
moving products out of and into physical stock. The stock operations for this are as follows:

.. table:: Stock situation resulting from manufacture

   ========================================= =========== ================================
   Location                                  Products    Step
   ========================================= =========== ================================
   Virtual Locations > Production            +2 Wheels   Consumption of raw materials
   Physical Locations > OpenERP S.A. > Stock -2 Wheels   Consumption of raw materials
   Virtual Locations > Production            +1 Frame    Consumption of raw materials
   Physical Locations > OpenERP S.A. > Stock -1 Frame    Consumption of raw materials
   Virtual Locations > Production            -1 Bicycle  Manufacture of finished products
   Physical Locations > OpenERP S.A. > Stock +1 Bicycle  Manufacture of finished products
   ========================================= =========== ================================

So you have now got the outcome you need from the consumption of raw materials and the manufacture of
finished products.

.. note::  Assessing created value

    You might already have noticed a useful effect of this approach:
    if you do a stock valuation in the ``Virtual Locations > Production`` location you get
    a statement of value created by your company (as a negative amount).
    Stock valuation in any given location is calculated by multiplying quantities of products in
    stock by their cost.
    In this case the raw material value is deducted from the finished product value.
