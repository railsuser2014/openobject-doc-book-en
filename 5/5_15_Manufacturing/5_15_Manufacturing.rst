Manufacturing
=============

Once the bills of materials have been defined, OpenERP is capable of automatically deciding on the manufacturing route according to the needs of the company.

Production orders can be proposed automatically by the system depending on several criteria described in the preceding chapter:

* Using the ``Make to Order`` rules,

* Using the ``Order Point`` (Minimum Stock) rules,

* Using the Production plan.

Of course, you can also start production manually by clicking the button :guilabel:`New` in the menu :menuselection:`Manufacturing --> Manufacturing --> Manufacturing Orders`.

   *Manufacturing Order*

.. index::
   single: module; mrp_jit

If you have not installed the Just-In-Time planning module :mod:`mrp_jit`, you should start
using OpenERP to schedule the Production Orders automatically using the
various system rules. To do this, use the menu :menuselection:`Warehouse --> Schedulers --> Compute Schedulers`.

.. tip:: Procurement Exceptions

	You must pay attention to the fact that you have to define `minimum stock rules` for each product that is in 
	``Make to Stock``.

Raw material consumption
++++++++++++++++++++++++

Finished product manufacturing
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Having manufactured the intermediate product CPU_GEN, OpenERP automatically proposes the manufacturing
of the computer PC2 using the order created earlier. So return to the menu for production orders to start 
:menuselection:`Manufacturing --> Manufacturing --> Manufacturing Orders`.

You will find computer PC2 which has been sold to the customer, as shown in the figure hereafter.

.. figure:: images/mrp_production_list_end.png
    :scale: 75

    *Complete the production for PC2*

Now that the production has been completed, the product sold to the customer has now been manufactured and the raw materials
have been consumed and taken out of stock.
 
.. tip:: Automatic Actions

    As well as managing the use of materials and the production of stocks, manufacturing can have the following
    automatic effects which are detailed further on in the chapter:
    
    * adding value to stock,
    * generating operations for assembly staff,
    * automatically creating analytical accounting entries.

    

Subproduct production
+++++++++++++++++++++

For the management of subproduct, you must install the module :mod:`mrp_subproduct` (Reconfigure wizard, MRP Sub-
products). The normal behaviour of manufacture in OpenERP enables you to manufacture several units of the
same finished product from raw materials (A + B > C). With subproduct management, the result of a manufacture can
be to have both finished products and secondary products (A + B > C + D).

.. note:: Subproduct Material

    In OpenERP, subproduct material corresponds to secondary products that are a by-product of the main manufacturing
    process. For example, cutting planks of timber will produce other planks but these bits of timber are too small 
    (or the offcuts may have value for the company if they can be used elsewhere).

If the module :mod:`mrp_subproduct` has been installed, you get a new tab Sub products in the Bill of Material
that lets you set secondary products resulting from the manufacture of the finished product.

.. figure:: images/mrp_bom_subproduct.png
    :scale: 75
    :align: center
    
    *Definition of Subproducts*

When OpenERP generates a production order based on a bill of materials that uses a secondary product, you pick
up the list of all products in the the second tab of the production order ``Finished Products``.
    
.. figure:: images/mrp_production.png
    :scale: 75
    :align: center
    
    *A production order producing several finished products*

Secondary products enable you to generate several types of products from the same raw materials and manufac-
turing methods - only these are not used in the calculation of requirements. Then, if you need the secondary
products, OpenERP will not ask you to manufacture another product to use the waste products and secondary
products of this manufacture. In this case, you should enter another production order for the secondary product.

..note: Services in Manufacturing

    Unlike most software for production management, OpenERP manages services as well as stockable products. So
    it is possible to put products of type Service in a bill of materials. These do not appear in the production 
    order but their requirements will be taken into account.
    
    If they are defined as Make to Order, OpenERP will generate a task for the manufacture or a subcontract
    order for the operations. The behaviour will depend on the Supply Method configured on the product form: Buy
    or Produce.

Scrapping
+++++++++

If you have to scrap the final product before it is finished, you will have to scrap every components
allowed to this product. 

.. figure:: images/mo_scrap.png
    :scale: 75
    :align: center
    
    *Scrapping a Product to Finish*

If you scrap a Product to Finish, you will get the situation illustrated in the previous figure. A 
finished product will be *created* and put in the scrapped virtual location, and a new Product to
Finish has been added to the manufacturing order.

.. tip:: Scrap a product

    To scrap a product, you have to edit the manufacturing order and then select the product to be
    scrapped by clicking on the little pencil on the left of the item.

This new product has been added because when you have to manufacture a product and if this product
has to be scrapped, you have to produce another product to replace the scrapped one. The reason why 
you have to scrap each component manually is that the production problem can come from one component.

If the production process is finished and you see that you have to scrap the finished product, you will
not have to scrap the different components. They are already *consumed*. They are not available anymore
for further manufacturing orders, they have been moved to the production Stock Location.

Production orders
+++++++++++++++++

To open a Production Order, use the menu
:menuselection:`Manufacturing --> Manufacturing --> Manufacturing Orders` and click on `New` button.
You get a blank form for entering a new production order as shown in the figure :ref:`fig-mrpprdnew`.

.. _fig-mrpprdnew:

.. figure:: images/mrp_production_new.png
   :scale: 75
   :align: center

   *New production order*

The production order follows the process given by the figure :ref:`fig-mrpprdproc`.

.. _fig-mrpprdproc:

.. figure:: images/mrp_production_processus.png
   :scale: 75
   :align: center

   *Process for handling a production order*

The `Scheduled date` , `Product Qty` and `Reference`, are automatically completed when the form is first opened.
Enter the product that you want to produce, and the quantity required. The :guilabel:`Product UOM` by
default is completed automatically by OpenERP when the product is first selected.

You then have to set two locations:

	* The location from which the required raw materials should be found, and

	* The location for depositing the finished products.

For simplicity, put the ``Stock`` location in both places. The field :guilabel:`Bill of Materials` will
automatically be completed by OpenERP when you select the product.  You
can then overwrite it with another BoM to specify something else to use for this specific
manufacture, then click the button :guilabel:`Compute Data`.

The tabs :guilabel:`Scheduled Products` and :guilabel:`Work Orders` are also completed automatically when you click
:guilabel:`Compute Data` (in the :guilabel:`Work Orders` or :guilabel:`Scheduled Products` tabs). 
You will find the raw materials there that are required for the production and the operations needed by the assembly staff.

If you want to start production, click the button :guilabel:`Confirm Production`, and OpenERP then
automatically completes the :guilabel:`Products to Consume` field in the :guilabel:`Consumed Products` tab and
:guilabel:`Products to Finish` field in :guilabel:`Finished Products` tab.

The information in the :guilabel:`Consumed Products` tab can be changed if:

* you want to enter a serial number for raw materials,

* you want to change the quantities consumed (lost during production).

For traceability, you can set lot numbers on the raw materials used, or on the finished
products.
Note the :guilabel:`Production Lot` and :guilabel:`Pack` numbers.

Once the order is confirmed, you should force the reservation of materials
using the :guilabel:`Force Reservation` button. This means that you do not have
to wait for the scheduler to assign and reserve the raw materials from your stock for this
production run. This shortens the procurement process.

If you do not want to change the priorities, just
leave the production order in this state and the scheduler will create a plan based on the priority
and your planned date.

.. todo:: Report that State is not shown on a Production Order

To start the production of products, click :guilabel:`Start Production`. The raw materials are then
consumed automatically from stock, which means that the draft ( ``Waiting`` ) movements become ``Done`` .

Once the production is complete, click :guilabel:`Produce`. The finished products are
then moved into stock.
