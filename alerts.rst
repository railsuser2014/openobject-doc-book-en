Alerts
------

Open ERP has an integrated alerts/warning system. You can configure alerts on any
step of any operation. The end-user will receive alerts on different events. We can
trigger alerts on the screen or through the internal requests system.

Key Points:
* Pre-configured warning module,
* Configure messages on partners, products, etc.

Integration Benefits:
* The same alert can be triggered from different operations: sales, invoices, stock deliveries.
* the alert system is a generic concept that can be used in any module.
